(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb</a>). We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we&#x27;re expanding to queues.<p>PeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).<p>Blog post here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres-change-data-capture"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres...</a>. 10-min quickstart here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart</a>.<p>We chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among our users is that it has a significant learning curve taking months to productionize.<p>A few issues are: a) Interacting through a command line interface, understanding the various settings, and learning best practices for running it in production is not trivial. Debezium UI, released to address usability concerns [1], is still in an incubating state [2]. Additionally, reading Debezium resources to get started can be overwhelming [3]. 
b) Supporting data formats and transformations isn’t easy. It needs a Java project, building JAR packages and setting up a runtime path on the kafka connect plugin. c)Debezium is not as native as Kafka for other queues and doesn’t offer the same level of configurability. For example, with Event Hubs, it is difficult to stream to topics spread across namespaces and subscriptions.<p>TL;DR Debezium aims to provide a comprehensive experience for engineers to implement CDC rather than making it dead simple for them. So you can do a lot with Debezium but need to know a lot about it.<p>At PeerDB, we are building a simple yet comprehensive experience for Postgres CDC. The goal is to enable engineers to build prod-grade Postgres CDC with a minimal learning curve, within a few days.<p>PeerDB’s feature-set isn&#x27;t at Debezium&#x27;s level yet, and as we evolve, we might face similar challenges. However, we&#x27;re putting usability at the forefront and we believe that we can achieve the above goal.<p>First, PeerDB offers a simple UI to set up Postgres and Kafka by creating PEERs and initiating CDC by creating a MIRROR. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of CDC, including throughput and latency; set up alerts to Slack&#x2F;Email based on replication slot growth; investigate Postgres-native metrics, including slot size, etc. Here is a demo showing of PeerDB UI in action:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04</a><p>Second, for users who prefer a CLI, we provide a Postgres-compatible SQL layer to manage CDC. This offers the same level of features as the UI and is more intuitive compared to bash scripts.<p>Third, users can perform row-level transformations using Lua scripts executed at runtime. This enables features such as encrypting&#x2F;masking PII data, supporting various data formats (JSON, MsgPack, Protobuf, etc.), and more. We offer a script editor along with a bunch of useful templates [5].<p>Fourth, we provide native connectors to non-Kafka targets. We also provide native configurability options tailored to these platforms. For example, with Event Hubs, users can perform CDC to topics distributed across different namespaces and subscriptions [4].<p>Finally, We are laser focused on Postgres, enabling specific optimizations like native metrics for replication, wait-events, and # of connections. Features like faster initial loads through parallel snapshotting and decoding transactions in-flight are in private beta.<p>Our hope is to provide the best data-movement experience for Postgres. PeerDB Streams is another step in that direction. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us.

That’s why I created GetAnyPlant, which aggregates and matches plants from dozens of online stores. It includes huge amounts of data on these plants along with filters and categories to help you search. You can also save plants to your wishlist and add notes to them.<p>I’m a data scientist by profession, so probably 80% of the work was totally new to me.

Due to this, individuals who are not familiar with the current SOTA are misinformed about the potential of generative models. So, we decided to open up some of our most popular templates as standalone tools for free to empower individuals and set a solid standard for what people should expect.<p>We believe the barrier to accessing cost-effective and powerful AI-powered solutions should be lowered, enabling us to achieve more collectively.<p>You can discover our other free tools on our web page as well. We have just started, and please share what you would like to see.<p>Best,

This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:<p>you just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.<p>Flying with waypoint-based navigation, not by &quot;programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial&quot; but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).<p>In fact, let&#x27;s throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!<p>And maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You&#x27;ll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.<p>And of course the big one, for the ultimate &quot;click button, JS flies the plane start to finish&quot; experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it&#x27;s a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We&#x27;re also implementing auto-landing and it&#x27;s going to be amazing.<p>If you play MSFS, and you&#x27;re a developer&#x2F;programmer, and you&#x27;ve always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of cool stuff you can do!<p>And of course if you don&#x27;t want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying</a> and have fun."

Do you need to rescue a drive, partition, or file from read errors?<p>ddrescue-helper.sh might be useful.<p>This is a pure bash script that hooks you up to the majesty that is GNU ddrescue, and makes it more useful.<p>For Linux and macOS.<p>Rescue...
- device-to-device
- device-to-file (image)
- file-to-file<p>Consistency checks help avoid user mistakes, such as trying to place the domain map on a target device, or targeting the boot drive.<p>Auto persistent un-mount via &#x2F;etc&#x2F;fstab ensures rescue integrity.<p>Ddrescue&#x27;s domain-map file and read-rate logs are placed in a directory named by the user.<p>Once you have a ddrescue domain map, a REPORT function lists files affected by read errors and slow-reads for supported filesystems...\
Linux: NTFS, ext2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4, HFS+\
macOS: HFS+.<p>Making a device or file copy is the best way to rescue. But if you need to work in situ with a filesystem or file that contains bad blocks, this helper offers a ZAP function that uses the domain map to write device blocks with read errors to attempt to make the blocks readable. This can regain access to an unreadable file, or make an un-mountable filesystem accessible, aiding further forensics (the data in the bad blocks are gone, but gaining device access may still be valuable).<p>An -K option allows ZAP of 4K blocks, for advanced format drives, instead of the default 512-byte block. This option may encourage the drive to re-allocate a bad sector.<p>(ZAP doesn&#x27;t rely on hdparm, it uses dd(1) to target single blocks.)<p>A PLOT function uses gnuplot to render the GNU ddrescue read-rate log as a simple graph at the terminal, helping you assess device health.<p>By rescuing (COPYING) to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null instead of a proper destination, you can SCAN a source to create the domain-map and read-rate log without replicating to another device. This lets you REPORT, ZAP, and PLOT a source without need for a target device-- maybe you don&#x27;t have a spare.<p>If nothing else, a bit assistance running GNU ddrescue might be just the ticket.<p>DOCUMENTATION:<p>- The github README.md

This script has so far only been tested by me and mistakes due to maker myopia are likely. Plus bash is a can&#x27;o&#x27;worms!<p>While I believe this helper is not fundamentally dangerous, try it in a situation that&#x27;s low stakes to start. There&#x27;s a time for disaster later.<p>Also try to overlook that a huge bash script seems like an epic security hazard.<p>If something goes wrong, you should&#x27;ve voted for Kodos.<p>—<p>I would appreciate laments about the approach and code.<p>The github README.md contains thoughts about many concerns &amp; improvements.\
(see TODOs at the end.)<p>I think the most gross part of this script is the mainline option processing, so pointers to idioms for smarter option processing will be appreciated.

And that sparked my curiosity with this question, what is considered affordable hardware for running large language models locally today? I&#x27;m aware that there&#x27;s a lot of work underway to make inference cheap to run at the edge but I&#x27;m curious to understand the landscape at present that anyone could purchase. I seen people running models on flagship smartphones but those are more expensive then a mac mini with worse performance.<p>By affordable I mean no greater then the cost of a current gen base model mac mini ($599) but ideally around the price of a raspberry pi 5 ($79) which when searching for budget PC gets mentioned[2]. Both devices have the same amount of ram in my case (8gb) but different performance observed given the importance of memory bandwidth. I mention these two because I&#x27;ve had experience running llama 3 via ollama on both with success although of slower speeds compared to a full workstation with a commodity GPU i.e. RTX 4090 which starts at ($1599). I&#x27;m interested in learning about what other devices are out there that people consider cheap and use for LLMs locally.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38646969<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;picks&#x2F;the-best-budget-desktop-computers"
