That’s why I created GetAnyPlant, which aggregates and matches plants from dozens of online stores. It includes huge amounts of data on these plants along with filters and categories to help you search. You can also save plants to your wishlist and add notes to them.<p>I’m a data scientist by profession, so probably 80% of the work was totally new to me.

(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb</a>). We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we&#x27;re expanding to queues.<p>PeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).<p>Blog post here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres-change-data-capture"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres...</a>. 10-min quickstart here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart</a>.<p>We chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among our users is that it has a significant learning curve taking months to productionize.<p>A few issues are: a) Interacting through a command line interface, understanding the various settings, and learning best practices for running it in production is not trivial. Debezium UI, released to address usability concerns [1], is still in an incubating state [2]. Additionally, reading Debezium resources to get started can be overwhelming [3]. 
b) Supporting data formats and transformations isn’t easy. It needs a Java project, building JAR packages and setting up a runtime path on the kafka connect plugin. c)Debezium is not as native as Kafka for other queues and doesn’t offer the same level of configurability. For example, with Event Hubs, it is difficult to stream to topics spread across namespaces and subscriptions.<p>TL;DR Debezium aims to provide a comprehensive experience for engineers to implement CDC rather than making it dead simple for them. So you can do a lot with Debezium but need to know a lot about it.<p>At PeerDB, we are building a simple yet comprehensive experience for Postgres CDC. The goal is to enable engineers to build prod-grade Postgres CDC with a minimal learning curve, within a few days.<p>PeerDB’s feature-set isn&#x27;t at Debezium&#x27;s level yet, and as we evolve, we might face similar challenges. However, we&#x27;re putting usability at the forefront and we believe that we can achieve the above goal.<p>First, PeerDB offers a simple UI to set up Postgres and Kafka by creating PEERs and initiating CDC by creating a MIRROR. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of CDC, including throughput and latency; set up alerts to Slack&#x2F;Email based on replication slot growth; investigate Postgres-native metrics, including slot size, etc. Here is a demo showing of PeerDB UI in action:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04</a><p>Second, for users who prefer a CLI, we provide a Postgres-compatible SQL layer to manage CDC. This offers the same level of features as the UI and is more intuitive compared to bash scripts.<p>Third, users can perform row-level transformations using Lua scripts executed at runtime. This enables features such as encrypting&#x2F;masking PII data, supporting various data formats (JSON, MsgPack, Protobuf, etc.), and more. We offer a script editor along with a bunch of useful templates [5].<p>Fourth, we provide native connectors to non-Kafka targets. We also provide native configurability options tailored to these platforms. For example, with Event Hubs, users can perform CDC to topics distributed across different namespaces and subscriptions [4].<p>Finally, We are laser focused on Postgres, enabling specific optimizations like native metrics for replication, wait-events, and # of connections. Features like faster initial loads through parallel snapshotting and decoding transactions in-flight are in private beta.<p>Our hope is to provide the best data-movement experience for Postgres. PeerDB Streams is another step in that direction. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us.

This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:<p>you just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.<p>Flying with waypoint-based navigation, not by &quot;programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial&quot; but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).<p>In fact, let&#x27;s throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!<p>And maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You&#x27;ll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.<p>And of course the big one, for the ultimate &quot;click button, JS flies the plane start to finish&quot; experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it&#x27;s a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We&#x27;re also implementing auto-landing and it&#x27;s going to be amazing.<p>If you play MSFS, and you&#x27;re a developer&#x2F;programmer, and you&#x27;ve always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of cool stuff you can do!<p>And of course if you don&#x27;t want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying</a> and have fun."

Do you need to rescue a drive, partition, or file from read errors?<p>ddrescue-helper.sh might be useful.<p>This is a pure bash script that hooks you up to the majesty that is GNU ddrescue, and makes it more useful.<p>For Linux and macOS.<p>Rescue...
- device-to-device
- device-to-file (image)
- file-to-file<p>Consistency checks help avoid user mistakes, such as trying to place the domain map on a target device, or targeting the boot drive.<p>Auto persistent un-mount via &#x2F;etc&#x2F;fstab ensures rescue integrity.<p>Ddrescue&#x27;s domain-map file and read-rate logs are placed in a directory named by the user.<p>Once you have a ddrescue domain map, a REPORT function lists files affected by read errors and slow-reads for supported filesystems...\
Linux: NTFS, ext2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4, HFS+\
macOS: HFS+.<p>Making a device or file copy is the best way to rescue. But if you need to work in situ with a filesystem or file that contains bad blocks, this helper offers a ZAP function that uses the domain map to write device blocks with read errors to attempt to make the blocks readable. This can regain access to an unreadable file, or make an un-mountable filesystem accessible, aiding further forensics (the data in the bad blocks are gone, but gaining device access may still be valuable).<p>An -K option allows ZAP of 4K blocks, for advanced format drives, instead of the default 512-byte block. This option may encourage the drive to re-allocate a bad sector.<p>(ZAP doesn&#x27;t rely on hdparm, it uses dd(1) to target single blocks.)<p>A PLOT function uses gnuplot to render the GNU ddrescue read-rate log as a simple graph at the terminal, helping you assess device health.<p>By rescuing (COPYING) to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null instead of a proper destination, you can SCAN a source to create the domain-map and read-rate log without replicating to another device. This lets you REPORT, ZAP, and PLOT a source without need for a target device-- maybe you don&#x27;t have a spare.<p>If nothing else, a bit assistance running GNU ddrescue might be just the ticket.<p>DOCUMENTATION:<p>- The github README.md

This script has so far only been tested by me and mistakes due to maker myopia are likely. Plus bash is a can&#x27;o&#x27;worms!<p>While I believe this helper is not fundamentally dangerous, try it in a situation that&#x27;s low stakes to start. There&#x27;s a time for disaster later.<p>Also try to overlook that a huge bash script seems like an epic security hazard.<p>If something goes wrong, you should&#x27;ve voted for Kodos.<p>—<p>I would appreciate laments about the approach and code.<p>The github README.md contains thoughts about many concerns &amp; improvements.\
(see TODOs at the end.)<p>I think the most gross part of this script is the mainline option processing, so pointers to idioms for smarter option processing will be appreciated. But beat me over the head in any way you like.<p>I am a github noob so I have no idea how collaboration works over there, but I&#x27;m ready to learn.<p>—<p>I truly enjoy the nightmare that is the Unix shell.

We just pivoted from drone delivery to build gpudeploy.com, a website that routes on-demand traffic for GPU instances to idle compute resources.<p>The experience is similar to lambda labs, which we’ve really enjoyed for training our robotics models, but their GPUs are never available for on-demand. We are also trying to make it more no-nonsense (no hidden fees, no H100 behind “contact sales”, etc.).<p>The tech to make this work is actually kind of nifty, we may do an in-depth HN post on that soon.<p>Right now, we have H100s, a few RTX 4090s and a GTX 1080 Ti online. Feel free to try it out!<p>Also, if you’ve got compute sitting around (a GPU cluster, a crypto mining operation or just a GPU) or if you’re an AI company with idle compute (hopefully not in a Stability AI way) and want to see some ROI, it’s very simple and flexible to hook it up to our site and you’ll maybe get a few researchers using your compute.<p>Nice rest of the week!"

And that sparked my curiosity with this question, what is considered affordable hardware for running large language models locally today? I&#x27;m aware that there&#x27;s a lot of work underway to make inference cheap to run at the edge but I&#x27;m curious to understand the landscape at present that anyone could purchase. I seen people running models on flagship smartphones but those are more expensive then a mac mini with worse performance.<p>By affordable I mean no greater then the cost of a current gen base model mac mini ($599) but ideally around the price of a raspberry pi 5 ($79) which when searching for budget PC gets mentioned[2]. Both devices have the same amount of ram in my case (8gb) but different performance observed given the importance of memory bandwidth. I mention these two because I&#x27;ve had experience running llama 3 via ollama on both with success although of slower speeds compared to a full workstation with a commodity GPU i.e. RTX 4090 which starts at ($1599). I&#x27;m interested in learning about what other devices are out there that people consider cheap and use for LLMs locally.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38646969<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;picks&#x2F;the-best-budget-desktop-computers"

Recently I was talking to my friends and it seems like all the mass consumer ideas have already been built. 
It is very hard to identify whether or not an idea is good.
But I think that for most entrepreneurs, once they think that an idea is great, they instantly start working on it.<p>But it is more heartbreaking than your girl dumping you, that someone else has already built your idea&#x2F;product.<p>Or even worse is that the product you want to build cannot be a real business.<p>That is why I have made a portal where a user has to enter their product idea and then after web scraping, a list of their competition will be generated. 
They will get an in-depth competition analysis and also a blueprint of what tech stack to use to build this, what type of challenges they might face in the particular industry(through llm) and if building this feature even possible.<p>Kindly lay on your active criticism as they are very valuable for me.<p>I know that their are static report generators online, but I also know that founders don&#x27;t have enough money to pay for it.<p>So even I might not charge for the services. Will just collect their emails and hopefully build a newsletter."

Take a look at our demo and give it a try on your emails at: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IST-DASLab&#x2F;PanzaMail"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IST-DASLab&#x2F;PanzaMail</a><p>Some technical details about Panza:<p>- Panza is an automated email assistant customized to your writing style and past email history.<p>- Panza produces a fine-tuned LLM that matches your writing style, pairing it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) component which helps it produce relevant emails.<p>- Panza *can be trained and run entirely locally*. Currently, it requires a single GPU with 16-24 GiB of memory, but we also plan to release a CPU-only version.<p>- Training and execution are also quick - for a dataset on the order of 1000 emails, training Panza takes well under an hour, and generating a new email takes a few seconds at most."

Type a keyword or a description of what you&#x27;re interested in, and you&#x27;ll get top links from HN surfaced to you along with brief summaries.<p>Unlike HN&#x27;s otherwise very valuable search feature, Hacker Search doesn&#x27;t require you to get your keywords exactly right. That&#x27;s achieved by leveraging OpenAI&#x27;s latest embedding models alongside more traditional indexes extracted from the scraped and cleaned up contents of the links.<p>I think there are many more interesting things one could build atop the HN dataset in the age of LLMs (e.g. more explicitly searching for technical opinions, recommending stories to you based on your interests, and making the core search feature more useful). If any of those sound interesting to you, head over to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackersearch.net&#x2F;signup"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackersearch.net&#x2F;signup</a> to get notified when I launch them!<p>Note: at least one person has built something similar before (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36391655"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36391655</a>).
