I went on a journey of learning how to detect and track satellite signals that are literally too quiet to hear, and I hope that some of the magic comes through in the posts!<p>After implementing this myself and walking the long road of getting it working, I’m left completely stunned by the brilliance of GPS, across so many axes. I hope you enjoy the read!<p>On a more personal note, I’ll be starting a new job next week which isn’t as amenable to publishing side projects, and therefore this will be my last publicly-published project for some time. I’ve had great experiences making and sharing projects on here, and I’m really grateful for the positive feedback that’s been shared!<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37736318"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37736318</a>",1713192130,Show HN: Building a GPS receiver,story,https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/

You can run `index_advisor()` to see if there should be an index on a select statement:<p><pre><code>    select *
    from index_advisor(&#x27;select book.id from book where title = $1&#x27;);
</code></pre>
And it will return (summarized):<p><pre><code>    {&quot;CREATE INDEX ON public.book USING btree (title)&quot;}
</code></pre>
It works particularly well with pg_stat_statements[0] which tracks execution statistics of all SQL statements executed on your Postgres database.<p>It leans heavily on HypoPG[1], an excellent extension to determine if PostgreSQL will use a given index without spending resources to create them.<p>[0] pg_stat_statements: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;pgstatstatements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;pgstatstatements.htm...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HypoPG&#x2F;hypopg"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HypoPG&#x2F;hypopg</a>",1713060876,Show HN: PostgreSQL index advisor,story,https://github.com/supabase/index_advisor

I am SUPER excited to publish our newest Weaviate podcast with Kyle Davis, the creator of RAGKit!<p>At a high-level, the podcast covers our understanding of RAG systems through 4 key areas: (1) Ingest &#x2F; ETL, (2) Search, (3) Generate &#x2F; Agents, and (4) Evaluation.<p>Discussing these lead to all sorts of topics from Knowledge Graph RAG, to Function Calling and Tool Selection, Re-ranking, Quantization, and many more!<p>This discussion forced me to re-think many of my previously held beliefs about the current RAG stack, particularly the definition of “Agents”. I came in believing that the best way of viewing “Agents” is an abstraction on top of multiple pipelines, such as an “Email Agent”, but Kyle presented the idea of looking at “Agents” as scoping the tools each LLM call is connected to, such as `read_email` or `calculator`. Would love to know what people think about this one, as I think getting a consensus definition of “Agents” can clarify a lot of the current confusion for people building with LLMs &#x2F; Generative AI.<p>I hope you find the podcast useful, this was such a fun one!

Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I can&#x27;t be bothered to burn a live ISO onto a USB stick. There&#x27;s initramfs, but it&#x27;s hardly a pleasant environment, with network configuration and all.<p>My go-to solution has typically been to create a chroot with busybox and a few utilities in &#x2F;tmp, chroot into it, and then kill services that use the solid drive so that I can unmount it. That&#x27;s an error-prone process, and sometimes systemd itself uses disk, so you can&#x27;t unmount the drive despite killing all the userland but PID 1.<p>This script improves the UX. It uses a Docker image as the chroot base, which is much easier to tailor to your needs, and automagically commits all the atrocities, such as tearing down all the userland processes, including PID 1, and re-spawning the host system from the container filesystem.<p>It also drives libostree and Nix users mad, because it can be used to try out a new DE or even a whole OS without polluting the host filesystem or spawning a virtual machine.

documentation, starting with its man pages, is presented in a format
that makes it easy for experts to look up details, not for beginners
to learn concepts or build skills.  O&#x27;Reilly, Sam&#x27;s, APress and others
have built large businesses selling second-best solutions to this
problem.<p>This is a teaching anti-pattern that emerges when domain experts --
<i>but teaching novices</i> -- try to write a curriculum from scratch.
They don&#x27;t realize that teaching is a separate skill from the material
to be taught, and that a great deal of effort is needed to break a
domain down into right-sized, self-sufficient chunks for the reader to
consume.  Instead, they produce big volumes of unorganized knowledge
(man pages) that reflects <i>their expert-level understanding</i>, that the
reader tries to sift through and, as often as not, gives up on in
frustration.  Even when you pay experts to write beginner-friendly
books, you get separate books on bash, awk, sed, grep, regexes, files,
processes, packages and so on.  These put the onus on the reader to
remember all the details and put them all together into something
useful.<p>Having dumped all this information on you, I always get the feeling
that the gurus are patting you on the head and saying, &quot;Well, learning
is hard.  You have to work at it.  Be sure you practice enough and
you&#x27;ll figure it all out eventually.&quot;  Learning is not supposed to be
easy, and you do have to practice, but too often that attitude serves
as an excuse to stop looking for better teaching methods.<p>So I&#x27;d like to propose one here.<p>The interactive piece takes place on the user&#x27;s machine.  They clone a
git repository that contains lots of text files that they can
manipulate with complex commands, according to lessons and exercises
delivered via a web app.  The web app helps the user remember using a
technique I call graduated spaced repetition, which extends the basic
SuperMemo algorithm to test <i>concepts</i>, not just facts, with
progressively more elaborate questions.<p>All of this should be relatively simple to write.  The main
differentiator will be good instructional design which -- sorry if I
sound like a jerk here -- I have not seen much in evidence in the 20
years I&#x27;ve spent learning this material.<p>Which brings me to my questions for you:<p>1. I know a lot of people have already tried to do this.  Can you point to any existing learning tools that have really knocked it out of the park?<p>2. What text processing tasks do you consider absolutely essential to  Unix command line proficiency?<p>3. What kinds of text files (Natural language text, CSV, logfiles, etc) would it be useful to practice on to get there?  Where can I find some?<p>If you want to talk about building the training set or the
extensions I&#x27;ve made to the SuperMemo protocol, or if you just want to
spitball ideas, you can email me at $MY_HN_USERNAME@gmail.com",1713134999,Ask HN: What do you need to know to be good at the Unix Command Line?,story,

For example there is painless (&lt;-- I hope!) zero-copy transmission of arbitrary combinations of STL-compliant native C++ data structures.<p>To help determine whether Flow-IPC is relevant to you we wrote an intro blog post.

Resources about  Cmake require you to go into the guts of Cmake. Resources about Meson require you to go into the guts of Meson. Compare that with, for example, learning about memory management. You can get quite in depth introductions and overviews of memory management without necessarily needing to get into the guts of x86-64 mm. Now, you often do. But usually as an exemplar towards the end, in order to illustrate the general principles that have been established.

I can only imagine the complexities they have to deal with, and at the same time there is a potential negative monetary impact. Valve makes boat loads of $$ from Counter-Strike through skins for weapons and models. It is its own economy. Banning people, even though they are cheaters, is money lost.<p>Furthermore, some of the solutions to deal with cheaters are to play on 3rd party services (i.e. FACEIT) that require you to install an &quot;anti-cheat&quot; that gives kernel level access and is owned by some questionable folks (I won&#x27;t get into the details of that you can do your own research).<p>That brings us to GamingHerd. For now, my idea is to be Google for PC video game cheaters, smurfs (read this about smurfs <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idnow.io&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;smurfing&#x2F;#:~:text=What%20is%20Smurfing%20in%20gaming,alternate%20account%20or%20multiple%20accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idnow.io&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;smurfing&#x2F;#:~:text=What%20is%20...</a>.), racists, throwers, etc. People you do not want to play video games with. Let me tell you, there are a lot, unfortunately.<p>Currently, I am working to grow this into a community and build a matchmaking service around it. The matchmaking would obviously utilize the Toxic Gaming DB (TGDB) to never allow them to use the service. I&#x27;ll also have community-driven moderation, you can read a bit more about that <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slash-lathe-f55.notion.site&#x2F;GamingHerd-moderation-overview-230a8966544947a796d9de389405c9e6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slash-lathe-f55.notion.site&#x2F;GamingHerd-moderation-ov...</a>. In the perfect world this is a community of trusted gamers that you want to play video games with.<p>Let me know what you all think. Look forward to your feedback.<p>Cheers,
