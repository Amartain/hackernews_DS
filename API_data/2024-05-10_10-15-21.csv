Like, sometimes I thought I included a screenshot, but the important information the engineer needed was what was actually right outside the boundary of the screenshot I took. Or I&#x27;d write that something &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot; but the engineer wasn&#x27;t sure if I meant that it returned an error or if it was unresponsive. So the engineer would be frustrated, I would be frustrated, and fixing stuff would slow to a halt while we went back and forth to clarify how to repro the issue over async Jira comments.<p>It’s actually pretty crazy that while so much has changed in how we develop software (heck, we have types in javascript now*), the way we capture and report bugs is just as manual and lossy as it was in the 1990’s. We can run assembly in the browser but there’s still no tooling to help a non-engineer show a bug to an engineer productively.<p>So that’s what Jam is. Dev tools + video in a link. It’s like a shareable HAR file synced to a video recording of the session. And besides video, you can use it to share an instant replay of a bug that just happened — basically a 30 second playback of the DOM as a video.<p>We’ve spent a lot of time adding in a ton of niceties, like Jam writes automatic repro steps for you, and Jam’s dev tools use the same keyboard shortcuts you’re used to in Chrome dev tools, and our team’s personal favorite: Jam parses GraphQL responses and pulls out mutation names and errors (which is important because GraphQL uses one endpoint for all requests and always returns a 200, meaning you usually have to sift through every GraphQL request when debugging to find the one you’re looking for)<p>We’re now 2 years in to the product being live and people have used Jam to fix more than 2 million bugs - which makes me so happy - but there’s still a ton to do. I wanted to open up for discussion here and get your feedback and opinions how can we make it even more valuable for you debugging?<p>The worst part of the engineering job is debugging and not even being able to repro the issue, it’s not even really engineering, it’s just a communication gap, one that we should be able to solve with tools. So yeah excited to get your feedback and hear your thoughts how we can make debugging just a little less frustrating.<p>(Jam is free to use forever — there is a paid tier for features real companies would need, but we’re keeping a large free plan forever. We learned to build products at Cloudflare and free tier is in our ethos, both my co-founder and I and about half the team is ex-Cloudflare) and what we loved there is how much great feedback we’d get because the product was mostly  free to use. We definitely want to keep that going at Jam.)<p>By the way, we’re hiring engineers and if this is a problem that excites you, we’d love to chat: jam.dev&#x2F;careers",1715346518,Show HN: A web debugger an ex-Cloudflare team has been working on for 4 years,story,

This is Jimmy, Ron and Austa from Muddy (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;</a>). Muddy is a browser for work that automatically keeps project files organized in the same place where you use and share them. Here’s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tZr49aN3sjQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tZr49aN3sjQ</a>. Download and try it out here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>Building together in the past, we were incredibly frustrated with how much friction there is to get anything done on our computers. I was losing time everyday digging through chat logs looking for that one important link or breaking others out of flow by asking where something is.<p>Web apps promised to help us get more done—and they do, but each in its own silo, so there’s still a ton of redundancy to deal with. Every app has its own way of organizing files, its own notification inbox, its own search system. Conversations live everywhere and there isn’t a single view to see everything about a project. Remember when files simply lived in folders rather than the “cloud”?<p>We started dedicating time to organizing our files in shared docs and limiting new apps we used. This helped – but the second we didn’t stay on top of organization, links became stale and things got messy again.<p>Muddy started as a hack week project we built for ourselves—a single place to use web apps with others, but personalized for each user automatically. Everyone gets their own view for every project, designed around how they work.<p>Muddy users work on projects in spaces, which are like automatic tab groups. Users share apps (any site works—a Github PR, Figma file, Trello board—whatever you want) into the project’s shared timeline and Muddy automatically opens relevant tabs for you. It’s a single click to open up all the apps you need for the project.<p>Under the hood, Muddy works in the background to keep track of the timeline and uses a LLM to continuously organize apps and keep everything on to date. It considers signals like the popularity of a file, naming conventions, and conversations to figure out what’s relevant. So everyone is presented with an updated list of important tabs, without anyone lifting a finger. Our actual browser is based on Chromium.<p>When you need to revisit something from weeks ago, you can rewind the project timeline to that point in a single click. Apps open up in the timeline so you’ll see your files right away. For sites that don’t have built in collaboration features (like documentation), Muddy lets you do annotations directly on the website.<p>Projects sometimes get big and need to be broken up. Across all your spaces, Muddy can answer questions like ChatGPT, cite your files as sources, and return apps directly. This is possible since Muddy’s AI shares your browser and can use your authenticated apps locally (with privacy in mind).<p>Other browsers like Chrome and Arc focus on solo productivity with sharing as a bolt-on. We think productivity depends on how well you can work with others, and should be the first class consideration. And doing organizational work manually is unsustainable.<p>Muddy will have paid subscriptions for teams with additional features like shared passwords, team organization, custom shortcuts, and SSO management. Those aren’t built out yet and the base product will be free. No part of our revenue will come from data monetization.<p>We’d love for you to give Muddy a spin! You can download Muddy for Mac or Windows on our website and add others once inside: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;</a>.

Ellipsis automatically reviews your PRs when opened and on each new commit. If you tag @ellipsis-dev in a comment, it can make changes to the PR (via direct commit or side PR) and answer questions, just like a human.<p>Demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X61NGZpaNQA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X61NGZpaNQA</a><p>So far, we have dozens of open source projects and companies using Ellipsis. We seem to have landed in a kind of sweet spot where there’s a good match between the current capabilities of AI tools and the actual needs of software engineers - this doesn’t replace human review, but it saves you time by catching&#x2F;fixing lots of small silly stuff.<p>Here’s an example in the wild: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;relari-ai&#x2F;continuous-eval&#x2F;pull&#x2F;38"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;relari-ai&#x2F;continuous-eval&#x2F;pull&#x2F;38</a>. Ellipsis (1) adds a PR summary; (2) finds a bug and adds a review comment; (3) after a (human) user comments, generates a side PR with the fix; and (4) after a (human) user merges the side PR and adds another commit, re-reviews the PR and approves it<p>Here’s another example: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SciPhi-AI&#x2F;R2R&#x2F;pull&#x2F;350#pullrequestreview-204013694"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SciPhi-AI&#x2F;R2R&#x2F;pull&#x2F;350#pullrequestreview-...</a>, where Ellipsis adds several comments with inline suggestions that were directly merged by the developer.<p>You can configure Ellipsis in natural language to enforce custom rules, style guides, or conventions. For example, here’s how the `jxnl&#x2F;instructor` repo uses natural language rules to make sure that docs are kept in sync: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;ellipsis.yaml#L13-L14"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;ellipsis.yaml#L...</a>, and here’s an example PR that Ellipsis came up with based on those rules: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;pull&#x2F;346"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;pull&#x2F;346</a>.<p>Installing into your repo takes 2 clicks at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ellipsis.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ellipsis.dev</a>.

It also gives you a simple visualization of the shape of what you&#x27;re knitting.  You can see it in action at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alefore.github.io&#x2F;knit&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alefore.github.io&#x2F;knit&#x2F;</a> (and read about it in <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit</a>).<p>Right now I only implemented on simple pattern: Sophie scarfs. After knitting one that came out somewhat … asymmetric, I decided to just write some software to help me (1) easily adjust the length&#x2F;width of the scarf (using Bézier curves), and (2) keep track of which row I&#x27;m on (so that I can make sure I apply increases&#x2F;decreases at the right places). In the future, I expect to extend this with many other knitting patterns for other types of items.<p>The application is 100% browser (JavaScript, tested in only in Chrome in Linux&#x2F;Android) based (no server-side component): all state is kept in the URL hash. I&#x27;ve used it to knit two scarves, including <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;images&#x2F;000.jpg"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;images&#x2F;000.jpg</a>.<p>The current state of knitting patterns is far from optional, stuck in pre-computer times. Perhaps knitters are not the most technically minded group. Most knitters just download patterns as PDF files. These files will show multiple numbers from which you should choose one depending on the size you&#x27;re knitting, saying things like &quot;Purl 24 (32 38 42 50 64) times&quot; (you&#x27;re supposed to pick the right number depending on the size you&#x27;re knitting). They&#x27;ll say things like &quot;repeat rows 4 to 6 sixteen times&quot;.<p>I think software can display patterns much better (including not being limited to a few pre-selected sizes, but letting you choose the _exact_ size you want, and adjusting everything accordingly), and keep track of your progress much more easily. For example, for my scarf, the user inputs the desired number of rows (based on the desired length, which makes the pattern agnostic to the needle size), and the software computes where to apply increases&#x2F;decreases.<p>I have many other ideas for improvements (e.g., track how much time I&#x27;ve spent in each row, show a clock), but I figured I&#x27;d share this early and ask for feedback.

SimBricks modularly combines existing simulators for machines, networks, and hardware, allowing you to build, test, and evaluate intricate complete systems in a virtual environment. Head over to the SimBricks website (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simbricks.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simbricks.github.io&#x2F;</a>, also has a quick demo video) to learn more. We have pre-built docker images, and you can even immediately play around on codespaces.<p>Concrete use-cases:
- Evaluate HW accelerators, from early design with simple behavioral models, to simulating complete Verilog implementations, both as part of complete systems with many instances of the accelerator and machines running full OS and real applications (we did a university course on this with SimBricks).
- Test network protocols, topologies, and communication stacks for real workloads in potentially large systems (we ran up to 1000 hosts so far).
- Rapid RTL prototyping for FPGAs, no waiting for synthesis or fiddling with timing initially (we simulate the complete unmodified RTL for the Corundum Open-source NIC with their unmodified PCIe drivers).<p>SimBricks originally started out as an internal research tool, for helping us build and evaluate our research ideas on network protocol offload, but has since grown into a separate open-source project.<p>Would be great if you give it a shot and let us know what you think!",1715206928,Show HN: SimBricks – Modular Full-System Simulation for HW-SW Systems,story,https://simbricks.github.io/

We are Baselit (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;</a>), a tool that automatically optimizes Snowflake costs. Here’s a demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ</a>.<p>Snowflake is one of the most widely used data warehouses today. It abstracts out the underlying compute infrastructure into “warehouses” for the user - compute units with t-shirt sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium etc.). In general, if you want to lower your data processing costs, the only thing you can do is to just process less data (i.e. query optimization). But Snowflake’s warehouse abstraction allows an extra dimension along which you can optimize - by minimizing the compute you need to process that same data (i.e. warehouse optimization). Baselit automates Snowflake warehouse optimization for you.<p>While we were working on another idea last year (AI for SQL generation), users frequently shared with us how Snowflake costs had become a top concern, and cost optimization was now their business priority. Every few months, they would manually look for opportunities to cut down on costs (removing workloads or optimizing queries) - a time consuming process. We decided to build a solution that could automate cost optimization, and complement the manual effort of data teams.<p>There are two key components of Baselit:<p>1. Automated agents that cut down on warehouse idle time. This happens in one of two ways: cache optimization (when to suspend a warehouse vs letting it run idle) and cluster optimization (optimal spin down of clusters).<p>You can easily find out how much these agents can save you. Here’s a SQL query that you can run on your Snowflake, and it will calculate your savings - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate</a><p>2. Autoscaler that lets you create custom scaling policies for multi-cluster warehouses based on SLAs. Snowflake’s default policies (Economy and Standard) are not cost optimal in most cases, and they don’t give you any control.<p>One use case for Autoscaler is that it helps you efficiently merge several warehouses into one multi-cluster warehouse - with a custom scaling policy that is optimal for a particular type of workload. In Autoscaler, you can set a parameter called “Allowed Queuing Time” that controls how fast a new cluster should spin up. For e.g. if you want to merge transformation workloads, you might want to set a higher queuing time. Baselit will slow down the cluster spin up, ensuring all clusters are running at a high utilization, and you’ll see a reduction in costs.<p>We’ve built a bunch of other features that help in optimizing Snowflake costs: a dbt optimization feature that automatically picks the right warehouse size for dbt models through constant experimentation, a “cost lineage”, spend views by teams&#x2F;roles&#x2F;users, and automatic recommendations from scanning Snowflake metadata.<p>Due to the nature of our product (access to Snowflake metadata required), we haven’t made Baselit self-serve yet. We invite you to run our savings query (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate</a>) and find out your potential savings.

Basically I&#x27;m hoping to land a frontend role where the design matters, like a user-facing website. Eventually, I would like to move into something like a UX developer role which actually takes part in the UX design process while still being (at least partially) a programming job.<p>My background includes 5 years experience with both backend and frontend work, but is heavily skewed towards the backend. I am working on this also by trying to position myself for any frontend work that comes up, but that&#x27;s a work-in-progress for sure.<p>Without a lot of frontend work to put on a resume, I&#x27;m looking for alternative ways to signal that I am motivated and capable of working in these kinds of roles. I was hoping that going through the UX Design certificate (on Coursera), and implementing the design projects that I would have to create as part of the program, would give me a resume filler and also some interesting projects to add to my portfolio site.

In simple terms, it is an AI-powered search engine specifically designed for developers.<p>Now, you might ask, with so many AI search engines already available—Perplexity, You.com, Phind, and several open-source projects—why do we need another one?<p>We all know that Generative Search Engines are built on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)[1] combined with Large Language Models (LLMs). Most of the products mentioned above use indexes from general search engines (like Google&#x2F;Bing APIs), but we&#x27;ve taken a different approach.<p>We&#x27;ve created a vertical search index focused on the development domain, which includes:<p>- Documents: These are essentially the single source of truth for programming languages or libraries; I believe many of you are users of Dash (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kapeli.com&#x2F;dash"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kapeli.com&#x2F;dash</a>) or devdocs (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devdocs.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devdocs.io&#x2F;</a>).<p>- Code: While not natural language, code contains rich contextual information. If you have a question related to the Django framework, nothing is more convincing than code snippets from Django&#x27;s repository.<p>- Web Search: We still use data from search engines because these results contain additional contextual information.<p>Our reasons for doing this include:<p>- The quality of the index is crucial to the RAG system; its effectiveness determines the output quality of the entire system.<p>- We focus more on the Index (RAG) rather than LLMs because LLMs evolve rapidly; even models performing well today may be superseded by better ones in a few months, and fine-tuning an LLM now has relatively low costs.<p>- All players are currently exploring what kind of LLM product works best; we hope to contribute some different insights ourselves (and plan to open source parts of our underlying infrastructure in return for contributions back into open source communities).<p>Some brief product features:<p>- Three modes: - Fast mode: Offers quick answers within seconds. - Agent mode: For complex queries where Devv Agent infers your question before selecting appropriate solutions. - GitHub mode(currently in beta): Links directly with your own GitHub repositories allowing inquiries about specific codebases.<p>- Clean &amp; intuitive UI&#x2F;UX design.<p>- Currently only available as web version but Chrome extension &amp; VSCode plugin planned soon!<p>Technical details regarding how we build our Index:<p>- Documents section involves crawling most documentation sources using scripts inspired by devdocs project’s crawler logic then slicing them up according function&#x2F;symbol dimensions before embedding into vector databases;<p>- Codes require special treatment beyond just embeddings alone hence why custom parsers were developed per language type extracting logical structures within repos such as architectural layouts calling relationships between functions definitions etc., semantically processed via LMM;<p>- Web searches combine both selfmade indices targeting developer niches alongside traditional API based methods. We crawled relevant sites including blogs forums tech news outlets etc..<p>For the Agent Mode, we have actually developed a multi-agent framework. It first categorizes the user&#x27;s query and then selects different agents based on these categories to address the issues. These various agents employ different models and solution steps.<p>Future Plans:<p>- Build a more comprehensive index that includes internal context (The Devv for Teams version will support indexing team repositories, documents, issue trackers for Q&amp;A)<p>- Fully localized: All of the above technologies can be executed locally, ensuring privacy and security through complete localization.<p>Devv is still in its very early stages and can be used without logging in. We welcome everyone to experience it and provide feedback on any issues; we will continue to iterate on it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.11401"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.11401</a>",1715181580,Show HN: I made a better Perplexity for developers,story,https://devv.ai

(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb</a>). We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we&#x27;re expanding to queues.<p>PeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).<p>Blog post here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres-change-data-capture"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres...</a>. 10-min quickstart here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart</a>.<p>We chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among our users is that it has a significant learning curve taking months to productionize.<p>A few issues are: a) Interacting through a command line interface, understanding the various settings, and learning best practices for running it in production is not trivial. Debezium UI, released to address usability concerns [1], is still in an incubating state [2]. Additionally, reading Debezium resources to get started can be overwhelming [3]. 
b) Supporting data formats and transformations isn’t easy. It needs a Java project, building JAR packages and setting up a runtime path on the kafka connect plugin. c)Debezium is not as native as Kafka for other queues and doesn’t offer the same level of configurability. For example, with Event Hubs, it is difficult to stream to topics spread across namespaces and subscriptions.<p>TL;DR Debezium aims to provide a comprehensive experience for engineers to implement CDC rather than making it dead simple for them. So you can do a lot with Debezium but need to know a lot about it.<p>At PeerDB, we are building a simple yet comprehensive experience for Postgres CDC. The goal is to enable engineers to build prod-grade Postgres CDC with a minimal learning curve, within a few days.<p>PeerDB’s feature-set isn&#x27;t at Debezium&#x27;s level yet, and as we evolve, we might face similar challenges. However, we&#x27;re putting usability at the forefront and we believe that we can achieve the above goal.<p>First, PeerDB offers a simple UI to set up Postgres and Kafka by creating PEERs and initiating CDC by creating a MIRROR. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of CDC, including throughput and latency; set up alerts to Slack&#x2F;Email based on replication slot growth; investigate Postgres-native metrics, including slot size, etc. Here is a demo showing of PeerDB UI in action:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04</a><p>Second, for users who prefer a CLI, we provide a Postgres-compatible SQL layer to manage CDC. This offers the same level of features as the UI and is more intuitive compared to bash scripts.<p>Third, users can perform row-level transformations using Lua scripts executed at runtime. This enables features such as encrypting&#x2F;masking PII data, supporting various data formats (JSON, MsgPack, Protobuf, etc.), and more. We offer a script editor along with a bunch of useful templates [5].<p>Fourth, we provide native connectors to non-Kafka targets. We also provide native configurability options tailored to these platforms. For example, with Event Hubs, users can perform CDC to topics distributed across different namespaces and subscriptions [4].<p>Finally, We are laser focused on Postgres, enabling specific optimizations like native metrics for replication, wait-events, and # of connections. Features like faster initial loads through parallel snapshotting and decoding transactions in-flight are in private beta.<p>Our hope is to provide the best data-movement experience for Postgres. PeerDB Streams is another step in that direction. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us.

Very much a work in progress, but building a LLM first PKMS (Personal Knowledge Management System). Here&#x27;s what it allows you to do:
- Express yourself in the way you want: supports text, whiteboards, OCR, audio and videos. Just dump info in the way you want.
- Comprehension and brainstorming: convert say whiteboard scribble to a diagram or text to chart.
- Notebook to interactive mindmaps using AI. You can also chat against the mindmap
- Export your notebook as content. Be it a blogpost or a newsletter or whatever.
- Chat support with references back to your notes across your whole knowledgebase.<p>Look forward to hearing feedback. It&#x27;s very early and I am a solo dev doing this part-time.",1715201285,Show HN: A multi-modal and AI first Knowledge Management System,story,https://www.anyscribe.io/

This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:<p>you just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.<p>Flying with waypoint-based navigation, not by &quot;programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial&quot; but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).<p>In fact, let&#x27;s throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!<p>And maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You&#x27;ll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.<p>And of course the big one, for the ultimate &quot;click button, JS flies the plane start to finish&quot; experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you?

In the past, I have created lots of calculators for my web projects and freelancing friends. These were pretty basic, but users always welcomed them.<p>I also used currently available builders, but the problem was that they were either slow, broke on mobile devices, had nonsense page view limits, or were expensive. Some even ticked all those boxes.<p>So I have decided to create my own, with a simple interface, and called it Creative Widgets (if it ever takes off, I plan to add more exciting stuff like charts, etc, hence why generic “Widgets”).<p>At this point, I am after feedback. I found myself running in a circle, building features because I think they&#x27;re great to have, but I would much rather have features that are wanted by users.<p>So, if your project&#x2F;web benefits from the custom calculator, you can check it out.<p>Thanks everyone.<p>Eugen",1715115257,Show HN: I made a calculator builder to increase engagement and conversions,story,https://creativewidgets.io/

I always wondered how they do it how they display those cards on the screen, do they have somebody watching the cameras and entering all this data manually, is there a fancy image recognition AI model in the background?<p>It appeared to be much simpler with the help of RFID. Each card has an RFID chip with a unique ID, and each player has an RFID scanner below the table, once the scanner detects the cards voilà we know what card the player has.<p>Once I found how it worked I had to do it myself, I found RFID readers that would do the job and I got RFID cards from Alibaba, the real challenge was the code behind it, I had to write a Node.js application that converts ID&#x27;s to cards, calculate chances, populate players and more, the use of Elgato Stream deck was also handy I wrote a small app that interacts with the Node application so we can fold players and take actions from the stream deck.

macOS: HFS+.<p>Making a device or file copy is the best way to rescue. But if you need to work in situ with a filesystem or file that contains bad blocks, this helper offers a ZAP function that uses the domain map to write device blocks with read errors to attempt to make the blocks readable. This can regain access to an unreadable file, or make an un-mountable filesystem accessible, aiding further forensics (the data in the bad blocks are gone, but gaining device access may still be valuable).<p>An -K option allows ZAP of 4K blocks, for advanced format drives, instead of the default 512-byte block. This option may encourage the drive to re-allocate a bad sector.<p>(ZAP doesn&#x27;t rely on hdparm, it uses dd(1) to target single blocks.)<p>A PLOT function uses gnuplot to render the GNU ddrescue read-rate log as a simple graph at the terminal, helping you assess device health.<p>By rescuing (COPYING) to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null instead of a proper destination, you can SCAN a source to create the domain-map and read-rate log without replicating to another device. This lets you REPORT, ZAP, and PLOT a source without need for a target device-- maybe you don&#x27;t have a spare.<p>If nothing else, a bit assistance running GNU ddrescue might be just the ticket.<p>DOCUMENTATION:<p>- The github README.md

Due to this, individuals who are not familiar with the current SOTA are misinformed about the potential of generative models. So, we decided to open up some of our most popular templates as standalone tools for free to empower individuals and set a solid standard for what people should expect.<p>We believe the barrier to accessing cost-effective and powerful AI-powered solutions should be lowered, enabling us to achieve more collectively.<p>You can discover our other free tools on our web page as well.
