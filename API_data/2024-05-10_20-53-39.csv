Like, sometimes I thought I included a screenshot, but the important information the engineer needed was what was actually right outside the boundary of the screenshot I took. Or I&#x27;d write that something &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot; but the engineer wasn&#x27;t sure if I meant that it returned an error or if it was unresponsive. So the engineer would be frustrated, I would be frustrated, and fixing stuff would slow to a halt while we went back and forth to clarify how to repro the issue over async Jira comments.<p>It’s actually pretty crazy that while so much has changed in how we develop software (heck, we have types in javascript now*), the way we capture and report bugs is just as manual and lossy as it was in the 1990’s. We can run assembly in the browser but there’s still no tooling to help a non-engineer show a bug to an engineer productively.<p>So that’s what Jam is. Dev tools + video in a link. It’s like a shareable HAR file synced to a video recording of the session. And besides video, you can use it to share an instant replay of a bug that just happened — basically a 30 second playback of the DOM as a video.<p>We’ve spent a lot of time adding in a ton of niceties, like Jam writes automatic repro steps for you, and Jam’s dev tools use the same keyboard shortcuts you’re used to in Chrome dev tools, and our team’s personal favorite: Jam parses GraphQL responses and pulls out mutation names and errors (which is important because GraphQL uses one endpoint for all requests and always returns a 200, meaning you usually have to sift through every GraphQL request when debugging to find the one you’re looking for)<p>We’re now 2 years in to the product being live and people have used Jam to fix more than 2 million bugs - which makes me so happy - but there’s still a ton to do. I wanted to open up for discussion here and get your feedback and opinions how can we make it even more valuable for you debugging?<p>The worst part of the engineering job is debugging and not even being able to repro the issue, it’s not even really engineering, it’s just a communication gap, one that we should be able to solve with tools. So yeah excited to get your feedback and hear your thoughts how we can make debugging just a little less frustrating.<p>(Jam is free to use forever — there is a paid tier for features real companies would need, but we’re keeping a large free plan forever. We learned to build products at Cloudflare and free tier is in our ethos, both my co-founder and I and about half the team is ex-Cloudflare) and what we loved there is how much great feedback we’d get because the product was mostly  free to use. We definitely want to keep that going at Jam.)<p>By the way, we’re hiring engineers and if this is a problem that excites you, we’d love to chat: jam.dev&#x2F;careers"

This is Jimmy, Ron and Austa from Muddy (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;</a>). Muddy is a browser for work that automatically keeps project files organized in the same place where you use and share them. Here’s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tZr49aN3sjQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tZr49aN3sjQ</a>. Download and try it out here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;</a>.<p>Building together in the past, we were incredibly frustrated with how much friction there is to get anything done on our computers. I was losing time everyday digging through chat logs looking for that one important link or breaking others out of flow by asking where something is.<p>Web apps promised to help us get more done—and they do, but each in its own silo, so there’s still a ton of redundancy to deal with. Every app has its own way of organizing files, its own notification inbox, its own search system. Conversations live everywhere and there isn’t a single view to see everything about a project. Remember when files simply lived in folders rather than the “cloud”?<p>We started dedicating time to organizing our files in shared docs and limiting new apps we used. This helped – but the second we didn’t stay on top of organization, links became stale and things got messy again.<p>Muddy started as a hack week project we built for ourselves—a single place to use web apps with others, but personalized for each user automatically. Everyone gets their own view for every project, designed around how they work.<p>Muddy users work on projects in spaces, which are like automatic tab groups. Users share apps (any site works—a Github PR, Figma file, Trello board—whatever you want) into the project’s shared timeline and Muddy automatically opens relevant tabs for you. It’s a single click to open up all the apps you need for the project.<p>Under the hood, Muddy works in the background to keep track of the timeline and uses a LLM to continuously organize apps and keep everything on to date. It considers signals like the popularity of a file, naming conventions, and conversations to figure out what’s relevant. So everyone is presented with an updated list of important tabs, without anyone lifting a finger. Our actual browser is based on Chromium.<p>When you need to revisit something from weeks ago, you can rewind the project timeline to that point in a single click. Apps open up in the timeline so you’ll see your files right away. For sites that don’t have built in collaboration features (like documentation), Muddy lets you do annotations directly on the website.<p>Projects sometimes get big and need to be broken up. Across all your spaces, Muddy can answer questions like ChatGPT, cite your files as sources, and return apps directly. This is possible since Muddy’s AI shares your browser and can use your authenticated apps locally (with privacy in mind).<p>Other browsers like Chrome and Arc focus on solo productivity with sharing as a bolt-on. We think productivity depends on how well you can work with others, and should be the first class consideration. And doing organizational work manually is unsustainable.<p>Muddy will have paid subscriptions for teams with additional features like shared passwords, team organization, custom shortcuts, and SSO management. Those aren’t built out yet and the base product will be free. No part of our revenue will come from data monetization.<p>We’d love for you to give Muddy a spin! You can download Muddy for Mac or Windows on our website and add others once inside: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feelmuddy.com&#x2F;</a>. We’ll be around to answer questions and look forward to any and all feedback!"

Ellipsis automatically reviews your PRs when opened and on each new commit. If you tag @ellipsis-dev in a comment, it can make changes to the PR (via direct commit or side PR) and answer questions, just like a human.<p>Demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X61NGZpaNQA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X61NGZpaNQA</a><p>So far, we have dozens of open source projects and companies using Ellipsis. We seem to have landed in a kind of sweet spot where there’s a good match between the current capabilities of AI tools and the actual needs of software engineers - this doesn’t replace human review, but it saves you time by catching&#x2F;fixing lots of small silly stuff.<p>Here’s an example in the wild: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;relari-ai&#x2F;continuous-eval&#x2F;pull&#x2F;38"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;relari-ai&#x2F;continuous-eval&#x2F;pull&#x2F;38</a>. Ellipsis (1) adds a PR summary; (2) finds a bug and adds a review comment; (3) after a (human) user comments, generates a side PR with the fix; and (4) after a (human) user merges the side PR and adds another commit, re-reviews the PR and approves it<p>Here’s another example: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SciPhi-AI&#x2F;R2R&#x2F;pull&#x2F;350#pullrequestreview-204013694"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SciPhi-AI&#x2F;R2R&#x2F;pull&#x2F;350#pullrequestreview-...</a>, where Ellipsis adds several comments with inline suggestions that were directly merged by the developer.<p>You can configure Ellipsis in natural language to enforce custom rules, style guides, or conventions. For example, here’s how the `jxnl&#x2F;instructor` repo uses natural language rules to make sure that docs are kept in sync: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;ellipsis.yaml#L13-L14"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;ellipsis.yaml#L...</a>, and here’s an example PR that Ellipsis came up with based on those rules: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;pull&#x2F;346"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jxnl&#x2F;instructor&#x2F;pull&#x2F;346</a>.<p>Installing into your repo takes 2 clicks at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ellipsis.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ellipsis.dev</a>.

It also gives you a simple visualization of the shape of what you&#x27;re knitting.  You can see it in action at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alefore.github.io&#x2F;knit&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alefore.github.io&#x2F;knit&#x2F;</a> (and read about it in <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit</a>).<p>Right now I only implemented on simple pattern: Sophie scarfs. After knitting one that came out somewhat … asymmetric, I decided to just write some software to help me (1) easily adjust the length&#x2F;width of the scarf (using Bézier curves), and (2) keep track of which row I&#x27;m on (so that I can make sure I apply increases&#x2F;decreases at the right places). In the future, I expect to extend this with many other knitting patterns for other types of items.<p>The application is 100% browser (JavaScript, tested in only in Chrome in Linux&#x2F;Android) based (no server-side component): all state is kept in the URL hash. I&#x27;ve used it to knit two scarves, including <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;images&#x2F;000.jpg"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alefore&#x2F;knit&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;images&#x2F;000.jpg</a>.<p>The current state of knitting patterns is far from optional, stuck in pre-computer times. Perhaps knitters are not the most technically minded group. Most knitters just download patterns as PDF files. These files will show multiple numbers from which you should choose one depending on the size you&#x27;re knitting, saying things like &quot;Purl 24 (32 38 42 50 64) times&quot; (you&#x27;re supposed to pick the right number depending on the size you&#x27;re knitting). They&#x27;ll say things like &quot;repeat rows 4 to 6 sixteen times&quot;.<p>I think software can display patterns much better (including not being limited to a few pre-selected sizes, but letting you choose the _exact_ size you want, and adjusting everything accordingly), and keep track of your progress much more easily. For example, for my scarf, the user inputs the desired number of rows (based on the desired length, which makes the pattern agnostic to the needle size), and the software computes where to apply increases&#x2F;decreases.<p>I have many other ideas for improvements (e.g., track how much time I&#x27;ve spent in each row, show a clock), but I figured I&#x27;d share this early and ask for feedback. Hopefully there are other fellow knitters in HN. :-) Check it out and let me know what you think!"

I was working on a different project (communities with better aligned incentives) for which I needed users to have access to a crypto wallet. I couldn&#x27;t afford users to have to deal with private keys and what not, and I did not feel comfortable being locked to a non-transparent third-party provider for something as important. So I built an internal &quot;wallet-as-a-service&quot; around audited librairies. I dropped the original project since then and that service evolved into Meemaw.<p>Many &quot;web3 projects&quot; would be better off without any web3 component. But if you do need your users to have a wallet, there are a few good reasons to use something like Meemaw:<p>- great UX (no faffing around with private keys or seed phrases, easily customisable)<p>- great DX (get up and running quickly, integrate with your existing system easily)<p>- more secure (MPC, trustless)<p>- low dependency risk (you&#x27;ve always got the option to self-host or export existing wallets)<p>If you&#x27;d like a refresher on MPC wallets or Wallet-as-a-Service, I did my best to explain it without BS industry jargon: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmeemaw.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mpc-wallet"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmeemaw.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mpc-wallet</a><p>If you have Docker and Node installed on your machine, you can have a full example running in less than 5 minutes: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmeemaw.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;getting-started"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmeemaw.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;getting-started</a><p>You can already self-host Meemaw, and there will soon be cloud hosting as well, with the option to easily switch from one to the other at any time.<p>The closed-source competitors are all (very) well-funded, but I think we can provide a better developer experience with higher security and reduced dependency risks. Right now, Meemaw is probably not ready for production, but we&#x27;ll get there sooner rather than later. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated to continue moving in the right direction :)"

We are Baselit (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;</a>), a tool that automatically optimizes Snowflake costs. Here’s a demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ</a>.<p>Snowflake is one of the most widely used data warehouses today. It abstracts out the underlying compute infrastructure into “warehouses” for the user - compute units with t-shirt sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium etc.). In general, if you want to lower your data processing costs, the only thing you can do is to just process less data (i.e. query optimization). But Snowflake’s warehouse abstraction allows an extra dimension along which you can optimize - by minimizing the compute you need to process that same data (i.e. warehouse optimization). Baselit automates Snowflake warehouse optimization for you.<p>While we were working on another idea last year (AI for SQL generation), users frequently shared with us how Snowflake costs had become a top concern, and cost optimization was now their business priority. Every few months, they would manually look for opportunities to cut down on costs (removing workloads or optimizing queries) - a time consuming process. We decided to build a solution that could automate cost optimization, and complement the manual effort of data teams.<p>There are two key components of Baselit:<p>1. Automated agents that cut down on warehouse idle time. This happens in one of two ways: cache optimization (when to suspend a warehouse vs letting it run idle) and cluster optimization (optimal spin down of clusters).<p>You can easily find out how much these agents can save you. Here’s a SQL query that you can run on your Snowflake, and it will calculate your savings - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate</a><p>2. Autoscaler that lets you create custom scaling policies for multi-cluster warehouses based on SLAs. Snowflake’s default policies (Economy and Standard) are not cost optimal in most cases, and they don’t give you any control.<p>One use case for Autoscaler is that it helps you efficiently merge several warehouses into one multi-cluster warehouse - with a custom scaling policy that is optimal for a particular type of workload. In Autoscaler, you can set a parameter called “Allowed Queuing Time” that controls how fast a new cluster should spin up. For e.g. if you want to merge transformation workloads, you might want to set a higher queuing time. Baselit will slow down the cluster spin up, ensuring all clusters are running at a high utilization, and you’ll see a reduction in costs.<p>We’ve built a bunch of other features that help in optimizing Snowflake costs: a dbt optimization feature that automatically picks the right warehouse size for dbt models through constant experimentation, a “cost lineage”, spend views by teams&#x2F;roles&#x2F;users, and automatic recommendations from scanning Snowflake metadata.<p>Due to the nature of our product (access to Snowflake metadata required), we haven’t made Baselit self-serve yet. We invite you to run our savings query (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate</a>) and find out your potential savings. And if you’d like to know more about any of our features and get a live demo, you can book one at this link - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;baselit-sahil&#x2F;baselit-demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;baselit-sahil&#x2F;baselit-demo</a><p>We’d love to read your feedback and ideas on Snowflake optimization!"

Head over to the SimBricks website (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simbricks.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simbricks.github.io&#x2F;</a>, also has a quick demo video) to learn more. We have pre-built docker images, and you can even immediately play around on codespaces.<p>Concrete use-cases:
- Evaluate HW accelerators, from early design with simple behavioral models, to simulating complete Verilog implementations, both as part of complete systems with many instances of the accelerator and machines running full OS and real applications (we did a university course on this with SimBricks).
- Test network protocols, topologies, and communication stacks for real workloads in potentially large systems (we ran up to 1000 hosts so far).
- Rapid RTL prototyping for FPGAs, no waiting for synthesis or fiddling with timing initially (we simulate the complete unmodified RTL for the Corundum Open-source NIC with their unmodified PCIe drivers).<p>SimBricks originally started out as an internal research tool, for helping us build and evaluate our research ideas on network protocol offload, but has since grown into a separate open-source project.<p>Would be great if you give it a shot and let us know what you think!"

But the online world of plants can be confusing - strange vocabulary, plants going by conflicting names, and hundreds of niche websites. I wanted to create a site that would organize all of this info and make it easier to explore and discover new plants. That’s why I created GetAnyPlant, which aggregates and matches plants from dozens of online stores. It includes huge amounts of data on these plants along with filters and categories to help you search. You can also save plants to your wishlist and add notes to them.<p>I’m a data scientist by profession, so probably 80% of the work was totally new to me.

(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb</a>). We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we&#x27;re expanding to queues.<p>PeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).<p>Blog post here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres-change-data-capture"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres...</a>. 10-min quickstart here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart</a>.<p>We chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among our users is that it has a significant learning curve taking months to productionize.<p>A few issues are: a) Interacting through a command line interface, understanding the various settings, and learning best practices for running it in production is not trivial. Debezium UI, released to address usability concerns [1], is still in an incubating state [2]. Additionally, reading Debezium resources to get started can be overwhelming [3]. 
b) Supporting data formats and transformations isn’t easy. It needs a Java project, building JAR packages and setting up a runtime path on the kafka connect plugin. c)Debezium is not as native as Kafka for other queues and doesn’t offer the same level of configurability. For example, with Event Hubs, it is difficult to stream to topics spread across namespaces and subscriptions.<p>TL;DR Debezium aims to provide a comprehensive experience for engineers to implement CDC rather than making it dead simple for them. So you can do a lot with Debezium but need to know a lot about it.<p>At PeerDB, we are building a simple yet comprehensive experience for Postgres CDC. The goal is to enable engineers to build prod-grade Postgres CDC with a minimal learning curve, within a few days.<p>PeerDB’s feature-set isn&#x27;t at Debezium&#x27;s level yet, and as we evolve, we might face similar challenges. However, we&#x27;re putting usability at the forefront and we believe that we can achieve the above goal.<p>First, PeerDB offers a simple UI to set up Postgres and Kafka by creating PEERs and initiating CDC by creating a MIRROR. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of CDC, including throughput and latency; set up alerts to Slack&#x2F;Email based on replication slot growth; investigate Postgres-native metrics, including slot size, etc. Here is a demo showing of PeerDB UI in action:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04</a><p>Second, for users who prefer a CLI, we provide a Postgres-compatible SQL layer to manage CDC. This offers the same level of features as the UI and is more intuitive compared to bash scripts.<p>Third, users can perform row-level transformations using Lua scripts executed at runtime. This enables features such as encrypting&#x2F;masking PII data, supporting various data formats (JSON, MsgPack, Protobuf, etc.), and more. We offer a script editor along with a bunch of useful templates [5].<p>Fourth, we provide native connectors to non-Kafka targets. We also provide native configurability options tailored to these platforms. For example, with Event Hubs, users can perform CDC to topics distributed across different namespaces and subscriptions [4].<p>Finally, We are laser focused on Postgres, enabling specific optimizations like native metrics for replication, wait-events, and # of connections. Features like faster initial loads through parallel snapshotting and decoding transactions in-flight are in private beta.<p>Our hope is to provide the best data-movement experience for Postgres. PeerDB Streams is another step in that direction. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us.

I am working on this also by trying to position myself for any frontend work that comes up, but that&#x27;s a work-in-progress for sure.<p>Without a lot of frontend work to put on a resume, I&#x27;m looking for alternative ways to signal that I am motivated and capable of working in these kinds of roles. I was hoping that going through the UX Design certificate (on Coursera), and implementing the design projects that I would have to create as part of the program, would give me a resume filler and also some interesting projects to add to my portfolio site.

If you have a question related to the Django framework, nothing is more convincing than code snippets from Django&#x27;s repository.<p>- Web Search: We still use data from search engines because these results contain additional contextual information.<p>Our reasons for doing this include:<p>- The quality of the index is crucial to the RAG system; its effectiveness determines the output quality of the entire system.<p>- We focus more on the Index (RAG) rather than LLMs because LLMs evolve rapidly; even models performing well today may be superseded by better ones in a few months, and fine-tuning an LLM now has relatively low costs.<p>- All players are currently exploring what kind of LLM product works best; we hope to contribute some different insights ourselves (and plan to open source parts of our underlying infrastructure in return for contributions back into open source communities).<p>Some brief product features:<p>- Three modes: - Fast mode: Offers quick answers within seconds. - Agent mode: For complex queries where Devv Agent infers your question before selecting appropriate solutions. - GitHub mode(currently in beta): Links directly with your own GitHub repositories allowing inquiries about specific codebases.<p>- Clean &amp; intuitive UI&#x2F;UX design.<p>- Currently only available as web version but Chrome extension &amp; VSCode plugin planned soon!<p>Technical details regarding how we build our Index:<p>- Documents section involves crawling most documentation sources using scripts inspired by devdocs project’s crawler logic then slicing them up according function&#x2F;symbol dimensions before embedding into vector databases;<p>- Codes require special treatment beyond just embeddings alone hence why custom parsers were developed per language type extracting logical structures within repos such as architectural layouts calling relationships between functions definitions etc., semantically processed via LMM;<p>- Web searches combine both selfmade indices targeting developer niches alongside traditional API based methods. We crawled relevant sites including blogs forums tech news outlets etc..<p>For the Agent Mode, we have actually developed a multi-agent framework. It first categorizes the user&#x27;s query and then selects different agents based on these categories to address the issues. These various agents employ different models and solution steps.<p>Future Plans:<p>- Build a more comprehensive index that includes internal context (The Devv for Teams version will support indexing team repositories, documents, issue trackers for Q&amp;A)<p>- Fully localized: All of the above technologies can be executed locally, ensuring privacy and security through complete localization.<p>Devv is still in its very early stages and can be used without logging in. We welcome everyone to experience it and provide feedback on any issues; we will continue to iterate on it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.11401"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.11401</a>"

This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:<p>you just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.<p>Flying with waypoint-based navigation, not by &quot;programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial&quot; but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).<p>In fact, let&#x27;s throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!<p>And maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You&#x27;ll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.<p>And of course the big one, for the ultimate &quot;click button, JS flies the plane start to finish&quot; experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it&#x27;s a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We&#x27;re also implementing auto-landing and it&#x27;s going to be amazing.<p>If you play MSFS, and you&#x27;re a developer&#x2F;programmer, and you&#x27;ve always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of cool stuff you can do!<p>And of course if you don&#x27;t want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying</a> and have fun."

Very much a work in progress, but building a LLM first PKMS (Personal Knowledge Management System). Here&#x27;s what it allows you to do:
- Express yourself in the way you want: supports text, whiteboards, OCR, audio and videos. Just dump info in the way you want.
- Comprehension and brainstorming: convert say whiteboard scribble to a diagram or text to chart.
- Notebook to interactive mindmaps using AI. You can also chat against the mindmap
- Export your notebook as content. Be it a blogpost or a newsletter or whatever.
- Chat support with references back to your notes across your whole knowledgebase.<p>Look forward to hearing feedback. It&#x27;s very early and I am a solo dev doing this part-time."

In the past, I have created lots of calculators for my web projects and freelancing friends. These were pretty basic, but users always welcomed them.<p>I also used currently available builders, but the problem was that they were either slow, broke on mobile devices, had nonsense page view limits, or were expensive. Some even ticked all those boxes.<p>So I have decided to create my own, with a simple interface, and called it Creative Widgets (if it ever takes off, I plan to add more exciting stuff like charts, etc, hence why generic “Widgets”).<p>At this point, I am after feedback. I found myself running in a circle, building features because I think they&#x27;re great to have, but I would much rather have features that are wanted by users.<p>So, if your project&#x2F;web benefits from the custom calculator, you can check it out.<p>Thanks everyone.<p>Eugen"

We are also trying to make it more no-nonsense (no hidden fees, no H100 behind “contact sales”, etc.).<p>The tech to make this work is actually kind of nifty, we may do an in-depth HN post on that soon.<p>Right now, we have H100s, a few RTX 4090s and a GTX 1080 Ti online. Feel free to try it out!<p>Also, if you’ve got compute sitting around (a GPU cluster, a crypto mining operation or just a GPU) or if you’re an AI company with idle compute (hopefully not in a Stability AI way) and want to see some ROI, it’s very simple and flexible to hook it up to our site and you’ll maybe get a few researchers using your compute.<p>Nice rest of the week!"
