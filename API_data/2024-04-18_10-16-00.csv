We’ve built a walk-away benchtop sample prep system that comes preloaded with apps that require no user programming or optimization, enabling labs to maximize resources, scale sample throughput, and reduce risks related to manual handling. I filmed a quick video in the lab if you want to see what it looks like IRL: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;935960826&#x2F;d0efdf3f14"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;935960826&#x2F;d0efdf3f14</a>.<p>Sample prep is the process of going from raw biological samples to sequenceable molecules. The process typically involves isolating nucleic acids from samples like blood&#x2F;cells, breaking up these nucleic acids into small pieces, and adding barcodes at a molecular level.<p>Although sequencing technologies have made huge advancements in general, sample preparation is largely still done manually and remains a bottleneck. Many companies, small and large, have attempted to develop solutions that haven’t panned out. A couple things make it so challenging:<p>(1) The number of sample types -  for humans alone, sample types include blood, saliva, various tissue types, buccal swab, etc. Each has its own requirements when it comes to handling to isolate nucleic acids, and even within each type there are significant differences. For example, blood from various donors has different cell density.<p>(2) There is a large array of chemistries for different analyses and sequencing technologies, and there is a need for flexibility in throughputs to process a few samples at a time or run large batches.<p>Developing a technology that is flexible enough to work with various sample types and chemistries while maintaining quality spans many disciplines: fluidic dynamics, thermal engineering, molecular biology, material science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and software engineering.<p>I didn’t set out to develop a way to automate sample prep. I was exploring the use of electrowetting to manipulate colored droplets on a circuit board during my research in the MIT Media Lab. During one of my demos, there was huge interest from biologists at the lab as well as from biotech&#x2F;pharma sponsors. I quickly began to realize that the application of this technology and the potential impact it could have was much larger than I had anticipated. I immediately got to work studying biology, focusing on five broad markets that included DNA sequencing and synthetic biology. The opportunity in the well-established DNA sequencing market begging for a solution to improve the quality of samples, reduce costs and create throughput flexibility led me to developing a way to automate sample prep. And here we are today, bringing it to market.<p>The Callisto Sample Prep System is a sequencer-agnostic benchtop system that enables a push-button, walkaway sample prep experience. This enables all labs—labs already using sequencing automation, and those new to sequencing—to free up resources and not rely on skilled labor to maximize throughput. By automating the process end to end, reliably, scientists can focus on other aspects of research and development.<p>What exactly does the instrument do? It manipulates little droplets on a surface using electric and magnetic fields. These droplets contain DNA, RNA, enzymes and other biochemistries, or they can be raw samples such as blood, saliva, etc. Once these droplets are on the surface, we move, merge, mix and split them in various ways. We also incubate these samples to specific temperatures on the same surface. We also use traditional robotic technologies such as gantry and pipettors for a limited set of operations.<p>Our approach has many advantages over existing technologies: it allows us to reduce total cost to our customers with less plastic waste and reagent usage; it improves quality of samples prepared; it provides reliable sample manipulation given the electric and magnetic nature of the technology; and it offers complete walk-away automation, bringing the push-button experience of a sequencer to sample prep.<p>I’m proud to bring a solution to the market that is accessible for all labs, especially labs with lower budgets (which are the majority). Now small core labs can provide low-cost, competitive solutions relative to commercial service providers, and larger labs can scale up their processes to make new sequencing technologies available to their customers. Individual labs at universities can now bring sequencers in-house for cost-effective, efficient, and reliable sequencing. So many applications, with huge potential impact for consumers!<p>Fewer than 5M humans have so far been exposed directly to sequencing technologies, yet sequencing technologies and life sciences tool development is what propels the modern world of biology. The only other field that has experienced advancements faster than sequencing technologies over the past two decades is AI, if that gives a basis of comparison for how big this is.<p>This level of sample prep automation is new to genomics, new to the world! I’m excited to hear your comments, questions, thoughts, ideas  - please share your insights and experiences to help us realize the full potential of this technology and make a tangible impact on science and society. And, go!"

It’s also capable of parsing and displaying debug information using DWARF&#x2F;PDB formats, which I hope will be useful even for just comparing codegen.<p>I’ve put a lot of effort into this and it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m releasing something like this publicly.

(It is 100% self-published, not endorsed by Google.)<p>So… I wrote a book. It’s a different book with a unique approach. It’s not a novel or a technical book. It’s a biography, a company’s biography. My hope is that it serves two purposes: to inspire founders and to captivate interior designers.<p>It all started three years ago. My wife and I were discussing interior design for our living room and she brought up what beautiful coffee table books should we have. After looking at her favorites I realized there’s nothing like this for tech startups. Digital products are intangible, how cool would it be to make them tangible and a beautiful art&#x2F;decor book for your home office or living room?<p>This idea of consolidating my particular interests with my wife’s decorative goals got stuck in the back of my head for a while. I searched and searched. I could only find these kinds of books related to design, architecture, fashion, or travel. Nothing about tech startups. The next logical step for me was to do it myself…<p>And oh… what a “mistake” it was. This whole project was done during nights and weekends - the first half while working on my startup and the last half while helping create Webflow Labs. You have no idea how many times I “quit” the project. In the end, perseverance and discipline were key to making it happen.<p>During my founder journey, I collected several notes about successful (and unsuccessful) tech startups to help me learn from them. I decided to write about Google’s fascinating story: a true generational company and one of the most valuable companies in the world.<p>It’s with great pleasure and satisfaction that I’m introducing you to “Google - First 25 Years”. A book celebrating the minds behind the tech giant&#x27;s incredible journey from Stanford to global dominance.<p>I have absolutely no idea if this book’s format and concept make sense or if it has an audience willing to invest ($169). Here are some of the unique features:<p>▪ Silk hardcover<p>▪ Limited edition<p>▪ Handpainted edges<p>▪ More than 30 handmade illustrations<p>I’m producing only 1,000 copies. If the book concept seems interesting enough, leave a comment, I’d love to know your thoughts!<p>Either way, this project was a super fun ride where being outside my comfort zone was the best way to learn storytelling, graphic design, and product manufacturing.<p>At least, I hope this inspires you to go back to your side projects and finish them!"

Like many of you, for my entire career I have relied on Homebrew to install all kinds of software on my Mac. That&#x27;s why today I&#x27;m really excited to share a new app that my partner and I are building: Brewer X, a refreshing user interface for Homebrew.<p>Brewer X is graphical interface that lives on top of Homebrew. Leveraging the power of native APIs improves the classic experience and unlocks new features. For example:<p>• bulk actions are performed in parallel<p>• syncing the entire library locally provides incredible search performances and the ability to query descriptions and other previously unaccessible fields<p>• maintenance scripts run automatically for you<p>• last but not least... app icons (or favicons when not available) let you quickly identify what you&#x27;re looking for<p>The app is written in Swift and uses only AppKit with Nib files for top performance, pixel perfect design, and maximum flexibility.<p>We also designed the app icon and all the others in the UI ourselves. Following the great insights from Sketch[^1] we managed to make them super crispy. We&#x27;re also very proud to have been featured in the macOS App Icon Book[^2].<p>The app has only been out for a couple of weeks, but we&#x27;ve already seen an amazing response from the community. We can&#x27;t tell you all of our future plans yet, but here&#x27;s a list of things we&#x27;d like to see in the app in the near future:<p>• Import&#x2F;Export<p>• Automatic replacement of apps installed without Homebrew<p>• Notifications about available updates<p>• Finder actions<p>• Spotlight integration<p>I hope you find Brewer X interesting. We&#x27;re happy to answer any question!<p>[^1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sketch.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-redesigned-our-toolbar-icons-for-big-sur-and-monterey&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sketch.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-redesigned-our-toolbar-ic...</a><p>[^2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appiconbook.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appiconbook.com&#x2F;</a>"

I went on a journey of learning how to detect and track satellite signals that are literally too quiet to hear, and I hope that some of the magic comes through in the posts!<p>After implementing this myself and walking the long road of getting it working, I’m left completely stunned by the brilliance of GPS, across so many axes. I hope you enjoy the read!<p>On a more personal note, I’ll be starting a new job next week which isn’t as amenable to publishing side projects, and therefore this will be my last publicly-published project for some time.

Finally, I trained a 30 million parameter model on 1 billion tokens and deployed it as a web service.
You can access the LLM using this site - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kunalmishra.info"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kunalmishra.info</a><p>The following steps were taken to build Tiny Tales GPT
1. Downloaded and preprocessed 8GB of dataset using multiprocessing library.
2. Tokenized the data using byte pair encoding to create 1 billion tokens sharded in different bin files.
3. Defined a training setup and trained the model on a small version of the LLaMA model architecture with 30 million parameters.
4. The training was done using Distributed Data-Parallel on two A-100 GPUs provided by JarvisLabs.ai (they are most cost-optimized)
5. After the training is done, an inference script is created to predict the tokens from the trained model given the input context vector.
6. Developed REST-based API service using Flask framework to interact with the inference service to the end user.
7. Finally used GCP&#x27;s virtual machines, instance groups, load balancers, and DNS services to deploy the service on the internet."

We are excited to announce the second release of Desbordante — an open-source, high-performance data profiler that is capable of discovering and validating many different patterns in data using various algorithms.<p>Unlike existing data profilers, Desbordante focuses on discovering complex patterns in data, which are notoriously hard to extract. Since its inception in 2019, it has become the fastest open-source tool for these tasks. It also offers an array of patterns which have no alternative implementations. With this release, Desbordante now supports 17 types of patterns, such as: various types of functional dependencies, inclusion and order dependencies, fuzzy algebraic constraints and many others.<p>Some ways in which Desbordante can be helpful are:
1) Hypothesis generation for scientists that work with large volumes of data.
2) Business data owners and business analysts can benefit from hypothesis generation as well as data quality improvement: cleaning databases from errors, finding and removing inexact duplicates, and so on.
3) Found primitives can help data scientists in feature engineering and choosing the right direction for ablation studies.<p>Desbordante solves two types of tasks: Discovery and Validation. The Discovery task is designed to identify all instances of a specified pattern type of a given dataset. The Validation task is different: it is designed to check whether a specified pattern instance is present in a given dataset. This task not only returns True or False, but it also explains why the instance does not hold (e.g. it can list table rows with conflicting values).<p>Desbordante offers a CLI, a web application, and a Python library. The latter makes it possible to construct ad-hoc data analysis pipelines — essentially, your own applications for various data quality tasks: data cleaning, data deduplication, anomaly detection, data schema recovery and many others. You can check out example implementations here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Desbordante&#x2F;desbordante-core&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Desbordante&#x2F;desbordante-core&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;ex...</a>.<p>Check out some of our articles for more details:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@chernishev&#x2F;exploratory-data-analysis-with-desbordante-4b97299cce07"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@chernishev&#x2F;exploratory-data-analysis-wit...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itnext.io&#x2F;building-a-simple-data-cleaning-application-with-desbordante-e4897dcd4c5d"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itnext.io&#x2F;building-a-simple-data-cleaning-applicatio...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levelup.gitconnected.com&#x2F;checking-mining-and-exploring-functional-dependencies-in-python-903bb0e26d5d"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levelup.gitconnected.com&#x2F;checking-mining-and-explori...</a><p>This major release brings a lot of improvements: support for several novel patterns, support for novel data type — graphs, added python bindings for existing patterns, better guides and examples and more.

- I’m familiar with some libraries and companies are doing this by building materialized views close to the DB [1][2], but I want to update the frontend, not just the backend.
- Some platforms like Supabase Realtime [3] and Firebase offer subscription models to database changes, but these solutions fall short when dealing with complex queries involving joins or group-bys.<p>My vision is that the modern frontend to behave like a series of materialized views that dynamically update as the underlying data changes. Current state management libraries handle state trees well but don&#x27;t seamlessly integrate with relational or graph-like database structures.<p>The only thing I can think of is to implement it by myself, which sounds like a big PITA.<p>Anything goes, Brainstorm with me.

We focus on fraud prevention at signup and login (preventing multi-accounting and account theft), but some customers were concerned about post-login security and asked us to add a session hijacking prevention feature to our fraud prevention API. In the end, we decided to just implement a solution in Javascript. We call it session-lock, and it can be used today across all browsers[2] and, theoretically, native mobile apps.<p>For a more comprehensive writeup and quick demo, you can visit the link. In short, the library adds a device-bound signature to the session token each time it’s used. At login, it creates a signing key pair on the browser using SubtleCrypto, with the private key set as “unextractable” and stored in IndexedDB (this forms the basis of its device-binding). Also at login, the public key is sent to the server along with the user’s credentials. If the credentials are valid, the server adds the public key to the payload of the JWT it returns to the client. When the client uses the JWT to access a protected resource, session-lock adds a signature to the end of it, along with a timestamp to mitigate replay attack risk. The server then validates the signature using the public key embedded in the JWT. The private key must be removed from IndexedDB upon logout.<p>While Chrome’s DBSC would be a nice solution when it gets around to being deployed in Chrome and Edge, I think session-lock would help a lot today across all browsers in countering common attacks like malicious browser extensions that rip LocalStorage and cookies. Also, implementing the general flow in native mobile apps[3] would have the same key advantages as DBSC - compiled code already on the device and utilization of hardware TPMs.<p>Aside from JS tampering and extracting “unextractable” CryptoKeys from IndexedDB, please let me know if you can think of any other potential attacks. Happy to answer any questions.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;fighting-cookie-theft-usin...</a>

Also, many gas boilers have capability to run more efficiently but are not configured to.<p>This particular boiler does not seem to respect the MM=0 command (despite OpenTherm&#x27;s such specification requirement) which is not uncommon. SAT sends the MM=0 command for the boiler to work at its minimum capacity. CS= minimum_setpoint and then PWM controls the ON&#x2F;OFF times of the boiler. However, I have a workaround which ensures that most of the time, the boiler is indeed working at its minimum modulation, unless the target flow (heating curve + PID) demand is high [higher than current flow temperature] during warm up.<p>The boiler supplies heat to the central heating and domestic hot water tank, but not at the same time. The hot water tank capacity is 255 litres. When DHW call is made, boiler ignores OpenTherm instructions and runs at 80 C degrees. There are three zone valves in the house: Hot Water, Upstairs and Downstairs (not talking about TRVs here). When DHW call is made, Hot Water valve opens, and Upstairs &amp; Downstairs close; then if CH call is made, Hot Water valve closes and the other two open.<p>The hot water system is also fitted with &quot;Waste Water Heat Recovery System&quot;. In essence, the heat energy extracted from showers and baths is used to preheat cold water that is then sent to the hot water tank. The extraction recovers about 60% of heat normally lost.

Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I can&#x27;t be bothered to burn a live ISO onto a USB stick. There&#x27;s initramfs, but it&#x27;s hardly a pleasant environment, with network configuration and all.<p>My go-to solution has typically been to create a chroot with busybox and a few utilities in &#x2F;tmp, chroot into it, and then kill services that use the solid drive so that I can unmount it. That&#x27;s an error-prone process, and sometimes systemd itself uses disk, so you can&#x27;t unmount the drive despite killing all the userland but PID 1.<p>This script improves the UX. It uses a Docker image as the chroot base, which is much easier to tailor to your needs, and automagically commits all the atrocities, such as tearing down all the userland processes, including PID 1, and re-spawning the host system from the container filesystem.<p>It also drives libostree and Nix users mad, because it can be used to try out a new DE or even a whole OS without polluting the host filesystem or spawning a virtual machine.

I&#x27;ve been hosting a small fleet of GPU servers for 3 years now on a public marketplace.<p>A couple of months ago I started building my own GPU Cloud as I believe this way users can get a better service in terms of support, reliability and functionality. Now it&#x27;s ready for the first users.<p>So why another GPU Cloud?
Well, firstly, high quality and reasonably priced cloud GPU providers are constantly out of capacity.<p>Another reason is the gripe I have with GPU marketplaces. It&#x27;s difficult to know whether the server you&#x27;re renting is in a proper data center or in someone&#x27;s hot and humid basement. This leads to reliability and performance issues which drags down the quality (and therefore the price) of the whole platform.
This incentivises building cheap unreliable servers to save on cost.<p>Additionally, the current GPU marketplaces are all focused on hosting Docker containers instead of virtual machines. This is fine for most use cases but it is a fundamental limitation. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of user complaints about not being able to run their image because of a driver&#x2F;kernel version mismatch. There are many more reasons which I could go into.<p>The goal of Backprop is to address these problems.
We&#x27;re hosted in a tier III data center. All instances are virtual machines with root access and fully dedicated IPv4 addresses. We&#x27;re reasonably priced (hopefully you agree) with no additional charges on storage&#x2F;bandwidth.<p>We currently only have RTX 3090 servers but we&#x27;re looking to expand our capacity soon.<p>Please share your feedback!<p>PS! We&#x27;re looking to build a high quality marketplace so if you know a host that meets these criteria, please get in touch!"

I am SUPER excited to publish our newest Weaviate podcast with Kyle Davis, the creator of RAGKit!<p>At a high-level, the podcast covers our understanding of RAG systems through 4 key areas: (1) Ingest &#x2F; ETL, (2) Search, (3) Generate &#x2F; Agents, and (4) Evaluation.<p>Discussing these lead to all sorts of topics from Knowledge Graph RAG, to Function Calling and Tool Selection, Re-ranking, Quantization, and many more!<p>This discussion forced me to re-think many of my previously held beliefs about the current RAG stack, particularly the definition of “Agents”. I came in believing that the best way of viewing “Agents” is an abstraction on top of multiple pipelines, such as an “Email Agent”, but Kyle presented the idea of looking at “Agents” as scoping the tools each LLM call is connected to, such as `read_email` or `calculator`. Would love to know what people think about this one, as I think getting a consensus definition of “Agents” can clarify a lot of the current confusion for people building with LLMs &#x2F; Generative AI.<p>I hope you find the podcast useful, this was such a fun one! Thank you so much for joining Kyle!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oEsJqMLYAfc"

Why?<p>As a teacher and cognitive scientist, the reason is interesting: Unix
documentation, starting with its man pages, is presented in a format
that makes it easy for experts to look up details, not for beginners
to learn concepts or build skills.  O&#x27;Reilly, Sam&#x27;s, APress and others
have built large businesses selling second-best solutions to this
problem.<p>This is a teaching anti-pattern that emerges when domain experts --
<i>but teaching novices</i> -- try to write a curriculum from scratch.
They don&#x27;t realize that teaching is a separate skill from the material
to be taught, and that a great deal of effort is needed to break a
domain down into right-sized, self-sufficient chunks for the reader to
consume.  Instead, they produce big volumes of unorganized knowledge
(man pages) that reflects <i>their expert-level understanding</i>, that the
reader tries to sift through and, as often as not, gives up on in
frustration.  Even when you pay experts to write beginner-friendly
books, you get separate books on bash, awk, sed, grep, regexes, files,
processes, packages and so on.  These put the onus on the reader to
remember all the details and put them all together into something
useful.<p>Having dumped all this information on you, I always get the feeling
that the gurus are patting you on the head and saying, &quot;Well, learning
is hard.  You have to work at it.  Be sure you practice enough and
you&#x27;ll figure it all out eventually.&quot;  Learning is not supposed to be
easy, and you do have to practice, but too often that attitude serves
as an excuse to stop looking for better teaching methods.<p>So I&#x27;d like to propose one here.<p>The interactive piece takes place on the user&#x27;s machine.  They clone a
git repository that contains lots of text files that they can
manipulate with complex commands, according to lessons and exercises
delivered via a web app.  The web app helps the user remember using a
technique I call graduated spaced repetition, which extends the basic
SuperMemo algorithm to test <i>concepts</i>, not just facts, with
progressively more elaborate questions.<p>All of this should be relatively simple to write.  The main
differentiator will be good instructional design which -- sorry if I
sound like a jerk here -- I have not seen much in evidence in the 20
years I&#x27;ve spent learning this material.<p>Which brings me to my questions for you:<p>1. I know a lot of people have already tried to do this.  Can you point to any existing learning tools that have really knocked it out of the park?<p>2. What text processing tasks do you consider absolutely essential to  Unix command line proficiency?<p>3. What kinds of text files (Natural language text, CSV, logfiles, etc) would it be useful to practice on to get there?  Where can I find some?<p>If you want to talk about building the training set or the
extensions I&#x27;ve made to the SuperMemo protocol, or if you just want to
spitball ideas, you can email me at $MY_HN_USERNAME@gmail.com"

I think I am reasonably competent at the craft of building software (writing tests and documentation, identifying code smells and antipatterns, applying design patterns and particular software programming styles where appropriate); I&#x27;m even pretty good at the bureaucratic work of filing tickets, maintaining the wiki, and writing self- and peer-evals through performance review season. But I have difficulty with being a proactive member within it: in other words, having a voice, leading initiatives, or feeling qualified to make meaningful decisions (technical or otherwise).<p>If pressed, I could describe my team&#x27;s OKRs and how my tickets move the needle on them. I could <i>not</i> describe what my teammates are working on, much less what adjacent teams are working on. There are a <i>lot</i> of design docs, architecture docs, and planning docs; I have a deluge of these tabs open, and I have a vague sense that it would be good to grok them, but when I take the time to read through them, I feel very little confidence that I understand well enough to put that knowledge to use. The only meetings I&#x27;ve ever scheduled were to ask for help getting unblocked on a ticket. I tend to drift off in meetings because people are almost always discussing things I have no context on and am not party to.<p>Can anyone recommend books that will help me engage better with the business that I work for, or get meaningful things done within it? I am not necessarily aiming for a management position, but would like to actively leverage the fact that I work in an organization: to create my own opportunities to work with people other than my manager and mentor, and in the process, to get things done for the business that is greater than the sum of us working separately."
