SimBricks modularly combines existing simulators for machines, networks, and hardware, allowing you to build, test, and evaluate intricate complete systems in a virtual environment. Head over to the SimBricks website (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simbricks.github.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simbricks.github.io&#x2F;</a>, also has a quick demo video) to learn more. We have pre-built docker images, and you can even immediately play around on codespaces.<p>Concrete use-cases:
- Evaluate HW accelerators, from early design with simple behavioral models, to simulating complete Verilog implementations, both as part of complete systems with many instances of the accelerator and machines running full OS and real applications (we did a university course on this with SimBricks).
- Test network protocols, topologies, and communication stacks for real workloads in potentially large systems (we ran up to 1000 hosts so far).
- Rapid RTL prototyping for FPGAs, no waiting for synthesis or fiddling with timing initially (we simulate the complete unmodified RTL for the Corundum Open-source NIC with their unmodified PCIe drivers).<p>SimBricks originally started out as an internal research tool, for helping us build and evaluate our research ideas on network protocol offload, but has since grown into a separate open-source project.<p>Would be great if you give it a shot and let us know what you think!"

We are Baselit (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;</a>), a tool that automatically optimizes Snowflake costs. Here’s a demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ls6VRzBQ-pQ</a>.<p>Snowflake is one of the most widely used data warehouses today. It abstracts out the underlying compute infrastructure into “warehouses” for the user - compute units with t-shirt sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium etc.). In general, if you want to lower your data processing costs, the only thing you can do is to just process less data (i.e. query optimization). But Snowflake’s warehouse abstraction allows an extra dimension along which you can optimize - by minimizing the compute you need to process that same data (i.e. warehouse optimization). Baselit automates Snowflake warehouse optimization for you.<p>While we were working on another idea last year (AI for SQL generation), users frequently shared with us how Snowflake costs had become a top concern, and cost optimization was now their business priority. Every few months, they would manually look for opportunities to cut down on costs (removing workloads or optimizing queries) - a time consuming process. We decided to build a solution that could automate cost optimization, and complement the manual effort of data teams.<p>There are two key components of Baselit:<p>1. Automated agents that cut down on warehouse idle time. This happens in one of two ways: cache optimization (when to suspend a warehouse vs letting it run idle) and cluster optimization (optimal spin down of clusters).<p>You can easily find out how much these agents can save you. Here’s a SQL query that you can run on your Snowflake, and it will calculate your savings - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate</a><p>2. Autoscaler that lets you create custom scaling policies for multi-cluster warehouses based on SLAs. Snowflake’s default policies (Economy and Standard) are not cost optimal in most cases, and they don’t give you any control.<p>One use case for Autoscaler is that it helps you efficiently merge several warehouses into one multi-cluster warehouse - with a custom scaling policy that is optimal for a particular type of workload. In Autoscaler, you can set a parameter called “Allowed Queuing Time” that controls how fast a new cluster should spin up. For e.g. if you want to merge transformation workloads, you might want to set a higher queuing time. Baselit will slow down the cluster spin up, ensuring all clusters are running at a high utilization, and you’ll see a reduction in costs.<p>We’ve built a bunch of other features that help in optimizing Snowflake costs: a dbt optimization feature that automatically picks the right warehouse size for dbt models through constant experimentation, a “cost lineage”, spend views by teams&#x2F;roles&#x2F;users, and automatic recommendations from scanning Snowflake metadata.<p>Due to the nature of our product (access to Snowflake metadata required), we haven’t made Baselit self-serve yet. We invite you to run our savings query (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baselit.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;savings-estimate</a>) and find out your potential savings.

In simple terms, it is an AI-powered search engine specifically designed for developers.<p>Now, you might ask, with so many AI search engines already available—Perplexity, You.com, Phind, and several open-source projects—why do we need another one?<p>We all know that Generative Search Engines are built on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)[1] combined with Large Language Models (LLMs). Most of the products mentioned above use indexes from general search engines (like Google&#x2F;Bing APIs), but we&#x27;ve taken a different approach.<p>We&#x27;ve created a vertical search index focused on the development domain, which includes:<p>- Documents: These are essentially the single source of truth for programming languages or libraries; I believe many of you are users of Dash (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kapeli.com&#x2F;dash"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kapeli.com&#x2F;dash</a>) or devdocs (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devdocs.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devdocs.io&#x2F;</a>).<p>- Code: While not natural language, code contains rich contextual information. If you have a question related to the Django framework, nothing is more convincing than code snippets from Django&#x27;s repository.<p>- Web Search: We still use data from search engines because these results contain additional contextual information.<p>Our reasons for doing this include:<p>- The quality of the index is crucial to the RAG system; its effectiveness determines the output quality of the entire system.<p>- We focus more on the Index (RAG) rather than LLMs because LLMs evolve rapidly; even models performing well today may be superseded by better ones in a few months, and fine-tuning an LLM now has relatively low costs.<p>- All players are currently exploring what kind of LLM product works best; we hope to contribute some different insights ourselves (and plan to open source parts of our underlying infrastructure in return for contributions back into open source communities).<p>Some brief product features:<p>- Three modes: - Fast mode: Offers quick answers within seconds. - Agent mode: For complex queries where Devv Agent infers your question before selecting appropriate solutions. - GitHub mode(currently in beta): Links directly with your own GitHub repositories allowing inquiries about specific codebases.<p>- Clean &amp; intuitive UI&#x2F;UX design.<p>- Currently only available as web version but Chrome extension &amp; VSCode plugin planned soon!<p>Technical details regarding how we build our Index:<p>- Documents section involves crawling most documentation sources using scripts inspired by devdocs project’s crawler logic then slicing them up according function&#x2F;symbol dimensions before embedding into vector databases;<p>- Codes require special treatment beyond just embeddings alone hence why custom parsers were developed per language type extracting logical structures within repos such as architectural layouts calling relationships between functions definitions etc., semantically processed via LMM;<p>- Web searches combine both selfmade indices targeting developer niches alongside traditional API based methods. We crawled relevant sites including blogs forums tech news outlets etc..<p>For the Agent Mode, we have actually developed a multi-agent framework. It first categorizes the user&#x27;s query and then selects different agents based on these categories to address the issues. These various agents employ different models and solution steps.<p>Future Plans:<p>- Build a more comprehensive index that includes internal context (The Devv for Teams version will support indexing team repositories, documents, issue trackers for Q&amp;A)<p>- Fully localized: All of the above technologies can be executed locally, ensuring privacy and security through complete localization.<p>Devv is still in its very early stages and can be used without logging in. We welcome everyone to experience it and provide feedback on any issues; we will continue to iterate on it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.11401"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2005.11401</a>"

I absolutely will not do this - it&#x27;s incredibly invasive and this is just a hosting service, not a bank.  And it&#x27;s a terrible idea.  If every company starts doing this the security implications are far worse than whatever problem they&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>Am I crazy?

(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PeerDB-io&#x2F;peerdb</a>). We spent the past 7 months building a solid experience to replicate data from Postgres to data warehouses. Now we&#x27;re expanding to queues.<p>PeerDB Streams provides a simple and native way to replicate changes as they happen in Postgres to Queues (Kafka, Redpanda, Google PubSub, etc). We use Postgres logical decoding to enable Change Data Capture (CDC).<p>Blog post here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres-change-data-capture"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.peerdb.io&#x2F;peerdb-streams-simple-native-postgres...</a>. 10-min quickstart here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.peerdb.io&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;streams-quickstart</a>.<p>We chose queues as many users found that existing tools are complex. Debezium is the most used tool for this use-case. It has large production usage. However, a common pain point among our users is that it has a significant learning curve taking months to productionize.<p>A few issues are: a) Interacting through a command line interface, understanding the various settings, and learning best practices for running it in production is not trivial. Debezium UI, released to address usability concerns [1], is still in an incubating state [2]. Additionally, reading Debezium resources to get started can be overwhelming [3]. 
b) Supporting data formats and transformations isn’t easy. It needs a Java project, building JAR packages and setting up a runtime path on the kafka connect plugin. c)Debezium is not as native as Kafka for other queues and doesn’t offer the same level of configurability. For example, with Event Hubs, it is difficult to stream to topics spread across namespaces and subscriptions.<p>TL;DR Debezium aims to provide a comprehensive experience for engineers to implement CDC rather than making it dead simple for them. So you can do a lot with Debezium but need to know a lot about it.<p>At PeerDB, we are building a simple yet comprehensive experience for Postgres CDC. The goal is to enable engineers to build prod-grade Postgres CDC with a minimal learning curve, within a few days.<p>PeerDB’s feature-set isn&#x27;t at Debezium&#x27;s level yet, and as we evolve, we might face similar challenges. However, we&#x27;re putting usability at the forefront and we believe that we can achieve the above goal.<p>First, PeerDB offers a simple UI to set up Postgres and Kafka by creating PEERs and initiating CDC by creating a MIRROR. Through the UI, users can monitor the progress of CDC, including throughput and latency; set up alerts to Slack&#x2F;Email based on replication slot growth; investigate Postgres-native metrics, including slot size, etc. Here is a demo showing of PeerDB UI in action:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ebcfb7646a1e48738835853b760e5d04</a><p>Second, for users who prefer a CLI, we provide a Postgres-compatible SQL layer to manage CDC. This offers the same level of features as the UI and is more intuitive compared to bash scripts.<p>Third, users can perform row-level transformations using Lua scripts executed at runtime. This enables features such as encrypting&#x2F;masking PII data, supporting various data formats (JSON, MsgPack, Protobuf, etc.), and more. We offer a script editor along with a bunch of useful templates [5].<p>Fourth, we provide native connectors to non-Kafka targets. We also provide native configurability options tailored to these platforms. For example, with Event Hubs, users can perform CDC to topics distributed across different namespaces and subscriptions [4].<p>Finally, We are laser focused on Postgres, enabling specific optimizations like native metrics for replication, wait-events, and # of connections. Features like faster initial loads through parallel snapshotting and decoding transactions in-flight are in private beta.<p>Our hope is to provide the best data-movement experience for Postgres. PeerDB Streams is another step in that direction. We would love to get your feedback on product experience, our thesis and anything else that comes to your mind. It would be super useful for us.

With the new Find My Device network, you’ll be able to locate your devices even if they’re offline. You can also find any compatible Fast Pair accessories when they’re disconnected from your device. This includes compatible earbuds and headphones, and trackers that you can attach to your wallet, keys, or bike.<p>To help you find your items when they’re offline, Find My Device will use the network of over a billion devices in the Android community and store your devices’ recent locations.<p>How it works<p>Devices in the network use Bluetooth to scan for nearby items. If other devices detect your items, they’ll securely send the locations where the items were detected to Find My Device. Your Android devices will do the same to help others [1] find their offline items when detected nearby.<p>Your devices’ locations will be encrypted using the PIN, pattern, or password for your Android devices. They can only be seen by you and those you share your devices with in Find My Device. They will not be visible to Google or used for other purposes.<p>You’ll get a notification on your Android devices when this feature is turned on in 3 days. Until then, you can opt out of the network [2] through Find My Device on the web. Your choice will apply to all Android devices linked to \[YOUR EMAIL\]. After the feature is on, you can manage device participation anytime through Find My Device settings on the device.<p>Learn more [3]<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;?p=crowdsourcing<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;find&#x2F;settings&#x2F;fmdn<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;?p=find_offline_devices"

In the past, I have created lots of calculators for my web projects and freelancing friends. These were pretty basic, but users always welcomed them.<p>I also used currently available builders, but the problem was that they were either slow, broke on mobile devices, had nonsense page view limits, or were expensive. Some even ticked all those boxes.<p>So I have decided to create my own, with a simple interface, and called it Creative Widgets (if it ever takes off, I plan to add more exciting stuff like charts, etc, hence why generic “Widgets”).<p>At this point, I am after feedback. I found myself running in a circle, building features because I think they&#x27;re great to have, but I would much rather have features that are wanted by users.<p>So, if your project&#x2F;web benefits from the custom calculator, you can check it out.<p>Thanks everyone.<p>Eugen"

This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:<p>you just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.<p>Flying with waypoint-based navigation, not by &quot;programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial&quot; but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).<p>In fact, let&#x27;s throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!<p>And maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You&#x27;ll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.<p>And of course the big one, for the ultimate &quot;click button, JS flies the plane start to finish&quot; experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it&#x27;s a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We&#x27;re also implementing auto-landing and it&#x27;s going to be amazing.<p>If you play MSFS, and you&#x27;re a developer&#x2F;programmer, and you&#x27;ve always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of cool stuff you can do!<p>And of course if you don&#x27;t want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying</a> and have fun."

I always wondered how they do it how they display those cards on the screen, do they have somebody watching the cameras and entering all this data manually, is there a fancy image recognition AI model in the background?<p>It appeared to be much simpler with the help of RFID. Each card has an RFID chip with a unique ID, and each player has an RFID scanner below the table, once the scanner detects the cards voilà we know what card the player has.<p>Once I found how it worked I had to do it myself, I found RFID readers that would do the job and I got RFID cards from Alibaba, the real challenge was the code behind it, I had to write a Node.js application that converts ID&#x27;s to cards, calculate chances, populate players and more, the use of Elgato Stream deck was also handy I wrote a small app that interacts with the Node application so we can fold players and take actions from the stream deck. 
Once I had it on I couldn&#x27;t resist making a platform with card history, player management, and a dealers panel."

This option may encourage the drive to re-allocate a bad sector.<p>(ZAP doesn&#x27;t rely on hdparm, it uses dd(1) to target single blocks.)<p>A PLOT function uses gnuplot to render the GNU ddrescue read-rate log as a simple graph at the terminal, helping you assess device health.<p>By rescuing (COPYING) to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null instead of a proper destination, you can SCAN a source to create the domain-map and read-rate log without replicating to another device. This lets you REPORT, ZAP, and PLOT a source without need for a target device-- maybe you don&#x27;t have a spare.<p>If nothing else, a bit assistance running GNU ddrescue might be just the ticket.<p>DOCUMENTATION:<p>- The github README.md

This script has so far only been tested by me and mistakes due to maker myopia are likely. Plus bash is a can&#x27;o&#x27;worms!<p>While I believe this helper is not fundamentally dangerous, try it in a situation that&#x27;s low stakes to start. There&#x27;s a time for disaster later.<p>Also try to overlook that a huge bash script seems like an epic security hazard.<p>If something goes wrong, you should&#x27;ve voted for Kodos.<p>—<p>I would appreciate laments about the approach and code.<p>The github README.md contains thoughts about many concerns &amp; improvements.\
(see TODOs at the end.)<p>I think the most gross part of this script is the mainline option processing, so pointers to idioms for smarter option processing will be appreciated. But beat me over the head in any way you like.<p>I am a github noob so I have no idea how collaboration works over there, but I&#x27;m ready to learn.<p>—<p>I truly enjoy the nightmare that is the Unix shell. So I have no intention of rewriting this in a more palatable language. I just wanted to hack together a tool to help me work with failing drives and this script took on a life of its own.<p>Blame these guys:<p>AT&amp;T The UNIX System: Making Computers More Productive (1982)<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0</a><p>I like to think that old K &amp; R and KenT would have only dreamed of shell utility that is this byzantine.<p>With any luck this code will soon be polluting a LLM."

We are also trying to make it more no-nonsense (no hidden fees, no H100 behind “contact sales”, etc.).<p>The tech to make this work is actually kind of nifty, we may do an in-depth HN post on that soon.<p>Right now, we have H100s, a few RTX 4090s and a GTX 1080 Ti online. Feel free to try it out!<p>Also, if you’ve got compute sitting around (a GPU cluster, a crypto mining operation or just a GPU) or if you’re an AI company with idle compute (hopefully not in a Stability AI way) and want to see some ROI, it’s very simple and flexible to hook it up to our site and you’ll maybe get a few researchers using your compute.<p>Nice rest of the week!"
