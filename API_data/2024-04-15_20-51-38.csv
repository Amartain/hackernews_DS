I went on a journey of learning how to detect and track satellite signals that are literally too quiet to hear, and I hope that some of the magic comes through in the posts!<p>After implementing this myself and walking the long road of getting it working, I’m left completely stunned by the brilliance of GPS, across so many axes. I hope you enjoy the read!<p>On a more personal note, I’ll be starting a new job next week which isn’t as amenable to publishing side projects, and therefore this will be my last publicly-published project for some time. I’ve had great experiences making and sharing projects on here, and I’m really grateful for the positive feedback that’s been shared!<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37736318"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37736318</a>"

You can run `index_advisor()` to see if there should be an index on a select statement:<p><pre><code>    select *

I am SUPER excited to publish our newest Weaviate podcast with Kyle Davis, the creator of RAGKit!<p>At a high-level, the podcast covers our understanding of RAG systems through 4 key areas: (1) Ingest &#x2F; ETL, (2) Search, (3) Generate &#x2F; Agents, and (4) Evaluation.<p>Discussing these lead to all sorts of topics from Knowledge Graph RAG, to Function Calling and Tool Selection, Re-ranking, Quantization, and many more!<p>This discussion forced me to re-think many of my previously held beliefs about the current RAG stack, particularly the definition of “Agents”. I came in believing that the best way of viewing “Agents” is an abstraction on top of multiple pipelines, such as an “Email Agent”, but Kyle presented the idea of looking at “Agents” as scoping the tools each LLM call is connected to, such as `read_email` or `calculator`. Would love to know what people think about this one, as I think getting a consensus definition of “Agents” can clarify a lot of the current confusion for people building with LLMs &#x2F; Generative AI.<p>I hope you find the podcast useful, this was such a fun one!

Purl features include Perl-like regex that simplifies text manipulation, it&#x27;s cross-platform so works equally well on macOS, Linux, etc., and it&#x27;s quick and easy to install. The tool also supports simple commands such as -replace, -filter, and -exclude, and offers optional color output to enhance readability.<p>Purl is a practical alternative to traditional tools like sed and grep, designed to address some of their common limitations.<p>For more information and to try purl yourself, visit: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;catatsuy&#x2F;purl"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;catatsuy&#x2F;purl</a><p>I appreciate any feedback!"

Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.<p>Looking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you&#x27;ve figured them out!<p>Oh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you&#x27;ll see -- it&#x27;s such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library."

Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I can&#x27;t be bothered to burn a live ISO onto a USB stick. There&#x27;s initramfs, but it&#x27;s hardly a pleasant environment, with network configuration and all.<p>My go-to solution has typically been to create a chroot with busybox and a few utilities in &#x2F;tmp, chroot into it, and then kill services that use the solid drive so that I can unmount it. That&#x27;s an error-prone process, and sometimes systemd itself uses disk, so you can&#x27;t unmount the drive despite killing all the userland but PID 1.<p>This script improves the UX. It uses a Docker image as the chroot base, which is much easier to tailor to your needs, and automagically commits all the atrocities, such as tearing down all the userland processes, including PID 1, and re-spawning the host system from the container filesystem.<p>It also drives libostree and Nix users mad, because it can be used to try out a new DE or even a whole OS without polluting the host filesystem or spawning a virtual machine.

Why?<p>As a teacher and cognitive scientist, the reason is interesting: Unix
documentation, starting with its man pages, is presented in a format
that makes it easy for experts to look up details, not for beginners
to learn concepts or build skills.  O&#x27;Reilly, Sam&#x27;s, APress and others
have built large businesses selling second-best solutions to this
problem.<p>This is a teaching anti-pattern that emerges when domain experts --
<i>but teaching novices</i> -- try to write a curriculum from scratch.
They don&#x27;t realize that teaching is a separate skill from the material
to be taught, and that a great deal of effort is needed to break a
domain down into right-sized, self-sufficient chunks for the reader to
consume.  Instead, they produce big volumes of unorganized knowledge
(man pages) that reflects <i>their expert-level understanding</i>, that the
reader tries to sift through and, as often as not, gives up on in
frustration.  Even when you pay experts to write beginner-friendly
books, you get separate books on bash, awk, sed, grep, regexes, files,
processes, packages and so on.  These put the onus on the reader to
remember all the details and put them all together into something
useful.<p>Having dumped all this information on you, I always get the feeling
that the gurus are patting you on the head and saying, &quot;Well, learning
is hard.  You have to work at it.  Be sure you practice enough and
you&#x27;ll figure it all out eventually.&quot;  Learning is not supposed to be
easy, and you do have to practice, but too often that attitude serves
as an excuse to stop looking for better teaching methods.<p>So I&#x27;d like to propose one here.<p>The interactive piece takes place on the user&#x27;s machine.  They clone a
git repository that contains lots of text files that they can
manipulate with complex commands, according to lessons and exercises
delivered via a web app.  The web app helps the user remember using a
technique I call graduated spaced repetition, which extends the basic
SuperMemo algorithm to test <i>concepts</i>, not just facts, with
progressively more elaborate questions.<p>All of this should be relatively simple to write.  The main
differentiator will be good instructional design which -- sorry if I
sound like a jerk here -- I have not seen much in evidence in the 20
years I&#x27;ve spent learning this material.<p>Which brings me to my questions for you:<p>1. I know a lot of people have already tried to do this.  Can you point to any existing learning tools that have really knocked it out of the park?<p>2. What text processing tasks do you consider absolutely essential to  Unix command line proficiency?<p>3. What kinds of text files (Natural language text, CSV, logfiles, etc) would it be useful to practice on to get there?  Where can I find some?<p>If you want to talk about building the training set or the
extensions I&#x27;ve made to the SuperMemo protocol, or if you just want to
spitball ideas, you can email me at $MY_HN_USERNAME@gmail.com"

The only thing we can&#x27;t redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam.

Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google&#x27;s SDK requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic, configure it in the console, and understand the documentation (which is quite shallow, by the way).<p>Anyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into &quot;realtime APIs&quot; with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.<p>Since it&#x27;s a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear your opinions.

Ours is interesting because it&#x27;s a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;</a><p>Others do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;descriptinc&#x2F;descript-audio-codec"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;descriptinc&#x2F;descript-audio-codec</a>) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion model is also particularly interesting because it is the first audio diffusion model to generate coherent lyrics!<p>We like diffusion models for music generation because they have some interesting properties that make controlling them easier (so you can make <i>your own</i> music instead of just taking what the machine gives you). For example, we have a rhythm control mode where you can upload your own percussion line or set a BPM. Very soon you&#x27;ll also be able to generate proper variations of an uploaded or previously generated song (e.g., you could even sing into Voice Memos for a minute and upload that!). @Musicians of HN, try uploading your songs and using Rhythm Control&#x2F;let us know what you think! Our goal is to enable more of you, not replace you.<p>For example, we turned this drum line (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz</a>) into this full song (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7</a> skip to 1:05 if impatient) or this other song I like better (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins</a> - we accidentally compressed it with AAC instead of Opus which hurt quality, though)<p>We also like diffusion models because while they&#x27;re expensive to train, they&#x27;re cheap to serve. We built our own efficient inference infrastructure instead of using those expensive inference as a service startups that are all the rage. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re making generations on our site free and unlimited for as long as possible.<p>We&#x27;d love to answer your questions. Let us know what you think of our first model! <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;</a>"

It’s an educational platform that provides an in-browser code editor and execution environment. The idea is to make teaching programming easier by eliminating the technical barriers that educators and students often face.<p>Feature highlights:
* In-Browser coding: Write, run, and debug code directly in your browser. No more downloading software, configuring environments, and resolving compatibility issues.
* Course management: Manage classes, assignments, and student interactions in one place.
* Many languages supported: Python, Java, JavaScript, C&#x2F;C++, C#, Go, PHP – more incoming.<p>Open beta access: I’d love it if interested people could join my open beta, explore the platform&#x27;s capabilities, and provide some feedback to help me make it a better tool.<p>Thank you for your time!<p>Contact: support@classroomio.app"

Cap&#x27;n Proto (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capnproto.org</a>) is fantastic at its core task - in-place serialization with zero-copy - and we wanted to make the IPC (inter-process communication) involving capnp-serialized messages be <i>zero-copy, end-to-end</i>.<p>That said, we paid equal attention to other varieties of payload; it&#x27;s not limited to capnp-encoded messages. For example there is painless (&lt;-- I hope!) zero-copy transmission of arbitrary combinations of STL-compliant native C++ data structures.<p>To help determine whether Flow-IPC is relevant to you we wrote an intro blog post. It works through an example, summarizes the available features, and has some performance results. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;flow-ipc-introductio...</a><p>Of course there&#x27;s nothing wrong with going straight to the GitHub link and getting into the README and docs.<p>Currently Flow-IPC is for Linux.

It comes with a React SDK that lets you  embed walkthroughs directly in your docs or marketing materials. Check out an example walkthrough on the home page.<p>Why build Annotate? I’ve been in the dev tooling space for the last 5 years and have two main learnings:<p>1. Developers first look for a quick start guide when exploring a technical product. A great quick start increase developer adoption.<p>2. Developers typically prefer code snippets that closely resemble real-world applications over traditional longer-form docs.<p>Annotate helps you solve both above points.<p>Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!"

Resources about  Cmake require you to go into the guts of Cmake. Resources about Meson require you to go into the guts of Meson. Compare that with, for example, learning about memory management. You can get quite in depth introductions and overviews of memory management without necessarily needing to get into the guts of x86-64 mm. Now, you often do. But usually as an exemplar towards the end, in order to illustrate the general principles that have been established.

An important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with a machine. What happens when that&#x27;s the case? Would people enjoy companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?<p>Whatever the answers, I can&#x27;t shake away the feeling that human uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of meaning.

I want to share a spreadsheet tool we are building. The main idea is to be able to specify logic for a no code tool inside a spreadsheet. We have automations, data integration,  action formulas, dashboards.<p>Linked example: We use our UPDATECELL formula to make a step in a board of game of life. We can also use CHAIN to make it run indefinitely. The actions are exposed as buttons in a dashboard.<p>Our automations work by loading your spreadsheet on the server and running an action specified in  the spreadsheet. So the logic could be, pull in data from google sheet, send a personalized email to every row which we haven’t emailed yet, mark those rows as complete. Run this automation on 5 minute schedule, add any other custom logic you need (e.g. test email for deliverability) and you have yourself an automatic email tool.<p>We are leaning into automations to differentiate ourselves from other products in the field at the moment.<p>Technical kinks:<p>- Since our automations make changes to the spreadsheet, we needed a robust multiplayer system. We implemented a CRDT system. This is a topic for a longer blog post, but one fun challenge was to implement CRDT for rows&#x2F;column which allowed for adding&#x2F;deleting&#x2F;reordering performantly while preserving most user intent in the case of offline editing.
- Some of our formulas are inherently asynchronous; for example those which fetch data from an external data source. That added an extra kink when writing the spreadsheet engine; e.g. topologically sorting and then evaluating in order can cause you to get stuck on a long running evaluation.
- One of our premises is that we do not store your data; it gets pulled when the spreadsheet evaluates. That means everything reevaluates in the browser when you open a spreadsheet. Get this to be performant (we still have a long way to go) was a challenge. Currently, everything runs in a single worker.<p>Let me know what you all think."

Anyone else disappointed?,story,,"My take:<p>* EVERYTHING was about Gemini (Google&#x27;s generative AI).  It became the running joke in the hallways and tram and eating area.  News flash: not everything needs or is approprite for gen ai.  So at this conference, anything not related to gen AI was left out.  There&#x27;s a talk about XYZ?   No.  There&#x27;s a talk about shoehorning gen ai into XYZ.<p>* So. Much. Marketing.  I&#x27;m a technical person.  I want technical details.  I want A LOT of technical details.  I need to know how different products interact with other products and what the limitations are so that I can actaully plan out how to use your product.  But there was only high-level marketing information given most of the time, so it was a complete waste of time.  Don&#x27;t forget the gen ai....<p>* The demonstrations often fell into two camps: cringey and useless (not mutually exclusive).  Of course these talks are practiced, but it&#x27;s obvious when someone is reading from a script.  Just don&#x27;t.  They were mostly useless, though, because they didn&#x27;t give any technical details or, when they did, the code was so small that it was unreadable.  The guy next to me tried to use his phone as binoculars to zoom in, but then it was still blurry.  You have a 30 foot screen... why is your code in 10% of it, and the rest is whitespace?  That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s because your whole UI has too much whitespace, too.  (Really... just look a the BigQuery studio screen, for example, and notice how much of the page is taken up by useless, non-collapsable whitespace!)<p>* The app just didn&#x27;t work sometimes.  The app didn&#x27;t transfer your &quot;likes&quot; from the website.  The app made it cumbersome to find out exactly where things were located on the map.  There was no direct link, so you had to back out of one area of the app to get into the map, only to find that the name didn&#x27;t match up directly, so now I had to back out of the map and re-find the thing that I was looking for, simply to have to back out of it again and re-navigate to the map.  Yeah.<p>* One.  There was exactly one talk that I went to that had any value whatsoever.  I&#x27;m glad that I went to it, but out of 3 days of conference talks, to only find one talk (on the 3rd day) that wasn&#x27;t a waste of time was, in a word, disappointing.  Other coworkers also found a talk that they really appreciated (we went to different talks because of the overlap), but that means that it was pretty much impossible for a single person to find multiple talks of value.  It&#x27;s all a gamble (which I suppose is why the conference was in Las Vegas).<p>* The expo.  That was the best part, because Google had their actual engineers there, and they were pleasant enough and polite enough to answer pointed, technical questions.  They were not marked.  I found the first one by talking to someone, who sent me somewhere else, and that person sent me to a different place, but I eventually found them, and it was amazing!  They were then able to point me to other people who could answer questions about other products that I use.<p>* In short: too much advertizing, not enough technical.  Too much &quot;this is what we want you to know about Google&#x27;s gen AI&quot; and not enough &quot;this will help you to better use out product.&quot;<p>Am I alone?  Am I simply jaded?"
