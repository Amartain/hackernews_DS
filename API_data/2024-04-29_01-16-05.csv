Gabriel_h,,40191915,,1,1714338413,Meticulous (YC S21) is hiring to eliminate E2E UI tests,job,,"Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a>.<p>Meticulous is a tool which creates and maintains a suite of e2e tests that exhaustively covers your web application - without any developer intervention whatsoever. We’ve also eliminated flaky tests (really!). No flakes. The tech behind this is fascinating.<p>Meticulous passively records sessions and uses these to generate a comprehensive test suite.<p>Our customers love the product and rely on meticulous.ai (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a>) as the sole system for testing their frontend. Here’s what they say:<p>“Once you start using Meticulous, you won’t want to stop. It provides confidence without the effort of writing and maintaining tests. I love the tight feedback loop of seeing a visual confirmation of my changes, and any unwanted side effects.” - Joel, engineer at Patchwork Health<p>“Meticulous eliminated the need to write and maintain frontend tests across my engineering organization. One of the most exciting DevTools on the market today.” - Seth, CTO at Courier<p>We trust Meticulous to be the sole front-end testing system for our app. It has caught countless UI bugs and regressions without us having to write a single test. This coverage saves us time and gives us confidence to move quickly.” - Nick, engineer at WithPower<p>How does Meticulous work?<p>Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch regressions before they hit production. It catches logical, behavioral and visual issues. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a><p>What’s our team like?<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir, GitHub and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of six. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds. - Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism. - Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar. - Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub."

Instead I&#x27;ll just say where I am coming from and avoid going into technical reasons too much..<p>I started frontend as a hobby in 2010, I&#x27;ve been working as one for 8 years. Jquery was great but everytime you had to invent your own MVP. Came angular and it was extremely verbose. Then came react, it didn&#x27;t have proper state thing nailed down like angular but it was simple, elegant, easy to reason and made code standardized and easy to read.<p>I could join a new team and be productive in 3 days as a FE dev. Unheard of prior to React.<p>However, gradually all that has been taken away.<p>In my view peak React was when it used class..<p>in constructor you defined state<p>in componentDidMount and simple life cycles methods you did things you needed to do.<p>Now functions are actually fake, it&#x27;s almost impossible to figure out when the app will render or update when the states changes. Hooks, HOC, Redux, etc... Now you hope it will does what it need to be done..<p>Before it was rock solid.. state management is even more messy and code is so far from procedural paradigm.. that you just hope. You can figure it out, but that&#x27;s the thing you shouldn&#x27;t have to figure out simple things. You didn&#x27;t need to before.<p>I recently made a chat app all in plain js, all in one file, and it works wonderfully. I surprised myself how easy to understand it is despite there being some lack of isolation... i&#x27;ve expanded the code at least 8 times so far and speed of delivery is remarkable.<p>Turns out it&#x27;s easy if there is no magic going and all code is simple, procedural, contained, and aptly named functions.<p>Best of all IDE actually helps a ton in refactoring."

These domains all use SquareSpace’s nameservers.<p>Reaching out to support is a nightmare because their agents are simply trained to say “you need to wait 72 hours” (which, I get is technically the limit but every other registrar I’ve worked with propagates settings within minutes or hours), and after 72 hours has passed with no update, they’ve simply stopped replying to me.

Our RAG framework, Cognita (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;truefoundry&#x2F;cognita"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;truefoundry&#x2F;cognita</a>), born from collaborations with diverse enterprises, is now open-source. Currently, it offers seamless integrations with Qdrant and SingleStore.<p>In recent weeks, numerous engineers have explored Cognita, providing invaluable insights and feedback. We deeply appreciate your input and encourage ongoing dialogue (share your thoughts in the comments – let&#x27;s keep this ‘open source’).<p>While RAG is undoubtedly powerful, the process of building a functional application with it can feel overwhelming. From selecting the right AI models to organizing data effectively, there&#x27;s a lot to navigate. While tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex simplify prototyping, an accessible, ready-to-use open-source RAG template with modular support is still missing. That&#x27;s where Cognita comes in.<p>Key benefits of Cognita:<p>1. Central repository for parsers, loaders, embedders, and retrievers.
2. User-friendly UI empowers non-technical users to upload documents and engage in Q&amp;A.
3. Fully API-driven for seamless integration with other systems.<p>We invite you to explore Cognita and share your feedback as we refine and expand its capabilities. Interested in contributing?

Our approach is predicated on the constructionist idea that people learn best by building things they care about and sharing them with others. The vision we have is to create a public collection of creative learning tools that offer people projects they can do right away and communities of practice to engage with.<p>Blot is our next installment in the series. It&#x27;s designed to be a gateway to CNC robotics through digital art.

We take care of the annoyances of external APIs (167 and counting) so you can quickly build custom integrations for your SaaS, while retaining full control over how they work.
2 min demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d04c67b47e284e86b91b4b99fba548ec"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;d04c67b47e284e86b91b4b99fba548ec</a><p>SaaS engineering teams face a tough choice: they can build each integration in-house from scratch, which gives them full control but takes a lot of time and maintenance effort. Or they can use pre-built solutions, which are fast and easy but less flexible and might not fulfill all customer needs.<p>Nango combines the best of both worlds. We let you quickly ship custom integrations without building complex infrastructure or diving deep into the quirks of each API. You control the business logic, data models, and customer-specific configurations, like custom field mappings. We handle (O)Auth and run your integrations reliably in production.<p>Under the hood, your integrations run as typescript “lambdas” on Nango. A typical integration has 3-5 lambdas of 20-50 lines of code each. These lambdas live inside your git repo, are version-controlled with the rest of your app, and get deployed to Nango with a CLI (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nango.dev&#x2F;understand&#x2F;core-concepts"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nango.dev&#x2F;understand&#x2F;core-concepts</a>).<p>Our runtime has a built-in scheduler for continuous background syncs, monitoring to know if your integrations run as expected, detailed logging of everything that happens in Nango, and pre-built infrastructure to deal with (O)auth, retries, rate-limit handling, webhook floods, data caching, de-duplication, etc. More here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nango.dev&#x2F;understand&#x2F;architecture"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nango.dev&#x2F;understand&#x2F;architecture</a><p>We have found that ChatGPT and Copilot let you build integrations on Nango very fast without having to learn each API’s intricacies. LLMs are great at figuring out which endpoint to use, what parameters it takes, etc. Paired with our runtime, this lets you build complex, high-scale integrations in hours instead of weeks.<p>We’ve put a ton of effort into dealing with API complexities, so you don’t have to. Even integrations that looked simple at first ended up forcing us to extend our infra to deal with their quirks and gotchas.<p>For example, we had to figure out 100+ different OAuth implementations (see <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nango.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-is-oauth-still-hard"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nango.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-is-oauth-still-hard</a> and <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35713518"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35713518</a>). We had to deal with a half-dozen non-standard auth methods (Github apps, Stripe apps, Netsuite, etc.), expiring webhooks, ways to deal with data dependencies, weird pagination methods, API keys that change with every API call, dozens of different ways to register for webhooks, etc. It’s a constantly moving target, but it is a challenge we have come to love, and we think the approach makes sense: we specialize in finicky details that vary from API to API—you specialize in making your product great and offering more integrations to your users.<p>Last but not least, Nango is open source (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NangoHQ&#x2F;nango</a>) under the ELv2 license (allows most use cases, except for direct copy-cats). Anybody can contribute new APIs &amp; share their integration templates with the community.<p>The fastest way to see Nango in action is with our interactive demo here (no signup required): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.nango.dev&#x2F;hn-demo"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.nango.dev&#x2F;hn-demo</a><p>Or take a look at our docs: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nango.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nango.dev</a><p>We would love to hear your feedback and look forward to the comments!"

In August 2017, I launched my first Airbnb unit, brimming with excitement and ambition. Bookings poured in, and life seemed like a whirlwind of success… until reality hit hard.<p>One fateful stay shattered the illusion. A nightmare guest wreaked havoc, leaving behind a trail of destruction totalling over $5000 in damages. To make matters worse, the guest retaliated with a scathing review, and I found myself staring at an account ban, my hosting aspirations hanging by a thread.<p>Faced with mounting losses and a tarnished reputation, I refused to accept defeat. Armed with determination and a thirst for justice, I took my battle to the Airbnb Resolution Centre. Despite presenting overwhelming evidence and the guest’s admission of liability, the verdict remained unchanged:<p>“After careful review… no reimbursement.”<p>It was a devastating blow. But from the ashes of despair, I rose with newfound resolve. I delved deep into the intricacies of winning guest damage disputes, leaving no stone unturned in my pursuit of redemption.<p>Fast forward to today, and my record speaks for itself – victory in every dispute waged, from guest damages to retaliatory reviews and account bans. But my triumph isn’t just a personal victory; it’s a beacon of hope for hosts everywhere. Too many endure the burden of guest damages alone or do not dispute correctly.<p>And so, HostDispute was born – a testament to resilience, a lifeline for hosts in distress. With our expert guidance and data-driven strategies, you’ll never face the nightmare alone. Together, we’ll reclaim your hosting dreams and rewrite the narrative, one dispute at a time."

Production bugs can be reproduced easily and code fixed quickly<p>- Have an interface that lets you access, view, and modify data in the production DB, kind of like Firebase. Might need a server of its own... or couldn&#x27;t that just be the app server itself?<p>- SQLite auto-backs up to a bucket (like Litestream)<p>I kinda really want this, but haven&#x27;t found anything quite like it.
