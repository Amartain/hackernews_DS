In the last years they’ve tried to cram more and more functionality I don’t care about (functions not related to syncing files) into the product, their menu-bar app has become a monster, and I’m tired of the up-sell nudges.<p>Apple is also transitioning all the cloud filesystem companies (like Dropbox, Google Drive, MS One Drive, etc) to use the MacOS File Provider API - probably a good thing to ensure there is a consistent experience for users. But that also makes me think they’re all going to perform exactly the same. I could be wrong of course.<p>Considering all that I want is for a directory tree to be mirrored between the cloud and my devices, are there any alternatives you’d recommend?

Works by ray marching a specific step size, reading a 3D texture (e.g. MRI data), and calculating opacity values.<p>Code should be easy to get started with for anyone familiar with the JS ecosystem.<p>Questions for the HN community: I spent 20-25% of the entire time just setting up the project and fighting issues with the JavaScript ecosystem. This experience has made me consider learning Cpp, Metal, and XCode. Has anyone made the transition from WebGL&#x2F;TS to Cpp or done it the other way around? What was your experience with it? And what about debugging? That&#x27;s a big issue with WebGL.<p>As for now, I&#x27;m thinking about picking up WebGPU next because it has an up-and-coming debugger made by Brendan Duncan[0] that looks promising.<p>Edit: Anyone know why MRI data is sent via CDs and not the web? I started working on this project specifically because some people close to me got MRI scans and received CDs of their results. I know that some MRI data can be huge so downloading over the web doesn&#x27;t make sense, but anything under 64MB should be sent over the web, no? For reference, I believe most MRI data can be under 250MB[1].<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brendan-duncan&#x2F;webgpu_inspector"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brendan-duncan&#x2F;webgpu_inspector</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Typical-image-dimensions-and-uncompressed-file-sizes-for-common-medical-imaging_tbl1_320511493"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Typical-image-dimensions...</a>"

Do it this weekend for S24,story,,"(Usually I put an &quot;Apply to YC&quot; thing in the HN footer [1] but I forgot this time, so here is my pitch to make up for it.)<p>If you&#x27;ve ever thought about applying to YC, here&#x27;s a tip: just do it. It doesn&#x27;t take long and could change your life, like it did for me and many others.<p>In particular, if you have either of these two bogus thoughts, ignore them pronto and just go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com</a> and apply:<p>(1) &quot;probably not good enough &#x2F; won&#x27;t get in&quot; - you&#x27;d be surprised at how many people feel that way, whether because of impostor syndrome, lack of credentials, whatever—and often they turn out to be among the best founders. So this a terrible reason not to apply!<p>The nice thing is, it&#x27;s YC&#x27;s job to evaluate that, not yours. They&#x27;re looking for aptitude which doesn&#x27;t look like what most people (probably including you) assume. You needn&#x27;t look impressive, and you don&#x27;t have to be a competent founder—you learn that from doing YC. Just be yourself as you are, fill out the application and don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>(2) &quot;too early&quot; - there&#x27;s no such thing. YC looks for good potential founders—meaning anyone who can learn what they teach—and nothing else. You&#x27;re already yourself, which is all you need.<p>Some of YC&#x27;s big successes start off as last-minute applications on a whim; and many start with totally different ideas than what ends up succeeding. It&#x27;s YC&#x27;s job to teach you how to play the startup game, and that can start at any time.<p>(&quot;Too far along already&quot; is another bogus notion but I&#x27;ll stick with the top 2 for today.)<p>If you know the game Snakes and Ladders [2], YC is a massive ladder in an area where there are no snakes. Sure it&#x27;s a dice roll, but what reason do you have not to? If you&#x27;re uninterested in the game, no problem—but if you have any impulse to participate, do it! If you&#x27;re the &quot;out of nowhere&quot; type of founder YC loves to fund, your chances are likely a lot better than you imagine.<p>Apply by 8pm PT on Monday 4&#x2F;22 to get a decision by May 29: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com</a>.<p>---<p>[1] like last October - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20231011022307&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20231011022307&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycom...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snakes_and_ladders"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snakes_and_ladders</a>"

It helps users to explore, understand, and gain visibility with no code modification.<p>With one instrumentation approach for all runtimes, AppView offers ubiquitous, unified instrumentation of any unmodified Linux executable.<p>With AppView 1.0.0 comes the new threat detection logic that allows users to capture security-related events. Is your application accessing secure files? Is it making connections it shouldn&#x27;t be? Is it exfiltrating data over DNS or is GOT poisoning in effect?<p>Other features of the 1.0.0 release include the ability to:<p>- Generate metrics on process and application performance.
- Generate events, reporting on network, file, logs, console messages and http&#x2F;s activity.
- Capture (decrypted) payload data without the need for keys.
- Generate a stack trace, and a core dump when an application crashes.
- Generate network flow information.
- Create a report on unique file and network activity.
- Install AppView in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Secure file and network access in an application.
- Instrument both static and dynamic executables.
- Attach to processes while they are running or start when the process does.
- Normalize and forward metrics and events, in real time, to remote systems.
- Summarize metrics and detect protocols.<p>We are looking for users and contributors alike."

Unlike any sane person who would go become a professor or make a gazillion dollars in industry, I decided to try bootstrapping my own software business. This is my first product.<p>The inspiration was from my research on computers understanding social norms. When ChatGPT came out, I was amazed how well it could understand social etiquette. I thought it&#x27;d be fun to make a game where you have to talk your way out of sticky situations - like you miss your friend&#x27;s birthday party, or your boss catches you trying to leave work at 2pm.<p>I made a prototype in a couple days, and it was super fun to play with. I thought I&#x27;d spend a &quot;couple months&quot; making a game for others to play online. Now, only 10 months and 923.3 hours of work later, it&#x27;s playable in early access.<p>In the game, you talk out loud (ASR), and the NPCs (LLM + TTS) talk back at you. It is fun to play with a friend! And because it&#x27;s just talking, non-gamers do great, often better than gamers.<p>I really want to have a free demo, but no time yet to implement. For now, it&#x27;s purchase only ($4.99). If anyone decides to try it, I&#x27;d really love to get more feedback. It was an enormous learning experience, especially targeting the web - so many partially supported web APIs and browser inconsistencies! Still feels like 2008 in some ways.<p>Also happy to answer questions of course. Thanks, and enjoy the weekend!"

Enough to pay the bills. And I realised, whereas in 2011 only say 30% of my costs were tech&#x2F;SaaS, now, 80% of them are. Is there a way to avoid this?<p>The crux of the matter is that I find some SaaS completely invaluable, like watching session replays (= finding bugs&#x2F;why people buy), accounting, and recently, using AI to prospect&#x2F;lead gen (and doing actual content myself, at conferences, via phone). Many times hosting is free on startup plans on cloud, but if you don&#x27;t create a new company entity, you often cannot access cloud credits for the smaller projects (sensibly), or you are paying OpenAI, so you are looking at $100-$500 for the tech too. I also feel they are kind of unoptional now: Sales response rates are 3-4x lower than what they were in 2011, because of AI prospecting&#x2F;the gradual train of spam and investors focusing on tech. So you need to counter this with tooling.<p>The thing is each of these services hit minimum plans these days of say $50-$100 for decent usage. And with 3-4 projects, this means I am paying the majority of my margins to them. I think back to 2011, when I had a short term startup, and with the market being less crowded (and luck), was able to generate revenue without any of this tech. Our only running cost was servers and accounting (which was cheaper). The problem then was always distribution, but now I know how to do that, the problem is actually the fixed costs. Nowadays I feel like if you don&#x27;t have a good enough UI&#x2F;quality (i.e. use session replay&#x2F;pay users for feedback), you just can&#x27;t get high enough revenue and retention. So I buy service after service for each project (as since 2022, more and more limit to one domain per plan etc or have worse free tiers than they used to), but it feels like I&#x27;m no further along than I was in 2011. Yes I have tried to self-host supabase and highlight.io, both were too hard to do for each site. Other software was self-hostable, but not the ones I&#x27;m paying for! (without all sorts of config for email auth, etc)<p>Come to think of it, will we ever see a service like &quot;Once&quot; cover these kind of things? Because SaaS boilerplates sort of solved that issue for me. It&#x27;s now the &quot;improvement and listening to users&quot; part that I am forking out money for."

    ScummVM - an interpreter for adventure game engines, notably LucasArts&#x27;s SCUMM
    OpenTTD - a reverse-engineered game engine of Transport Tycoon, which led to numerous ports and improvements over the original
    Ports of Dr. Mario and Kwirk for the TI-89 calculator
    &quot;The Idiot&quot; - a card game for Windows
    WebWorks - a text HTML editor
    Spotify - a commercial music streaming service
    Spotiamp - a lightweight Spotify Premium client for Windows, created as a tribute to Winamp
    TunSafe - a VPN client for Windows using the WireGuard protocol

I realised I need to spin up a couple of home servers and VPSs to simplify and localise my digital life, and I have an RPi and an x86 NAS in my home network, and a VPS in the cloud. They run different hardware and distros, so I have to set them up a bit differently, which is a pain of itself, but what makes matters worse is a situation when I mess something up real bad or when there&#x27;s another reason that essentially forces me to reinstall.<p>I tried Ansible and find it hard to use. E.g. at some point I decided to redeploy my server to a different VPS type in the same cloud, but I had to patch my Ansible scripts to do so, even though it was the same Rocky Linux distro (and it failed at some random docker compose networking config IIRC). I guess, Ansible scripts aren&#x27;t reproducible and require constant work to keep them working. But I very much like them vs just SSH-ing into servers.<p>That leads to my question. Is there anything I can do to write config once and just deploy it more or less reliably? NixOS looks interesting, but learning another programming language just for this feels a bit too much for me. Or maybe there&#x27;s another way to do stuff like this which I overlook as I&#x27;m in a different industry?"

2 years ago I had a child with my wife and moved in a small town in Italy, where in-laws help us.
I&#x27;m working fully remote since then for a company.<p>I think I have reached some sort of burnout&#x2F;depression.<p>I am home all day long and I do not find enjoyment for what I do anymore (it has been like that for many years, but I never wanted to face it).
Recently it struck me: my job will be one of the first ones wich will be replaced by AI. Maybe not tomorrow, but sooner that many think.
Even if it doesn&#x27;t happen I still will end up depressed in a few months if I don&#x27;t do something.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I have the will or strength to learn anything else.
I studied computer science, but I wasn&#x27;t good, just average.
Now I have forgotten pretty much everything about algorithm, calculus or algebra, I have only used JavaScript as programming language.
I have built full stack applications, but never went deep into anything, always stayed in the shallows.<p>This is obviously my fault.<p>Right now I feel I am stuck in a bad place, not sure on what to do...
I guess this is a plea for help?
