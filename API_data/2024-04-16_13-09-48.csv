CloudCruise is a graph-based workflow builder for web agents. Our DSL lets you orchestrate LLM-powered web actions with loops, conditionals and memory. Here is a 1 min demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4AQfl5Gj_Ro"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4AQfl5Gj_Ro</a><p>We tried out existing web agents and found zero-shot planning unreliable for longer workflows. That’s why we’ve built a framework that lets you define a graph-based workflow. Every action is modelled as a node and edges between nodes define the next action to take.<p>There are two different node type categories: Low-level browser interaction nodes and high-level reasoning nodes. Low-level nodes are actions like clicking, inputing text or navigating to a new URL. High-level nodes are able to extract structured data from a webpage or make a conditional decision based on the content of the webpage.<p>All of the nodes can be configured with a prompt in natural language. For instance, if you had a list of websites you could define a click-node with a prompt “Click on the contact page”. This ensures that workflows generalize to different websites independent of the layout.<p>Our early users use us to automate tasks like:<p>1. Find the contact information of fire department chiefs in the US
2. Check the HR information of all employees registered on Gusto
3. Automate background research on people they have meetings with in Google Calendar<p>We just released our chrome extension where you can build &amp; run workflows for yourself. Its free for up to 200 browser actions a month. We’d love for you to try it and give us feedback. You can find the link to our extension through our landing page: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudcruise.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudcruise.com&#x2F;</a><p>Last but not least, here are some of the strange things we’ve encountered so far whilst automating the web:<p>1.

Also, many gas boilers have capability to run more efficiently but are not configured to.<p>This particular boiler does not seem to respect the MM=0 command (despite OpenTherm&#x27;s such specification requirement) which is not uncommon. SAT sends the MM=0 command for the boiler to work at its minimum capacity. CS= minimum_setpoint and then PWM controls the ON&#x2F;OFF times of the boiler. However, I have a workaround which ensures that most of the time, the boiler is indeed working at its minimum modulation, unless the target flow (heating curve + PID) demand is high [higher than current flow temperature] during warm up.<p>The boiler supplies heat to the central heating and domestic hot water tank, but not at the same time. The hot water tank capacity is 255 litres. When DHW call is made, boiler ignores OpenTherm instructions and runs at 80 C degrees. There are three zone valves in the house: Hot Water, Upstairs and Downstairs (not talking about TRVs here). When DHW call is made, Hot Water valve opens, and Upstairs &amp; Downstairs close; then if CH call is made, Hot Water valve closes and the other two open.<p>The hot water system is also fitted with &quot;Waste Water Heat Recovery System&quot;. In essence, the heat energy extracted from showers and baths is used to preheat cold water that is then sent to the hot water tank. The extraction recovers about 60% of heat normally lost.

I went on a journey of learning how to detect and track satellite signals that are literally too quiet to hear, and I hope that some of the magic comes through in the posts!<p>After implementing this myself and walking the long road of getting it working, I’m left completely stunned by the brilliance of GPS, across so many axes. I hope you enjoy the read!<p>On a more personal note, I’ll be starting a new job next week which isn’t as amenable to publishing side projects, and therefore this will be my last publicly-published project for some time. I’ve had great experiences making and sharing projects on here, and I’m really grateful for the positive feedback that’s been shared!<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37736318"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37736318</a>"

You can run `index_advisor()` to see if there should be an index on a select statement:<p><pre><code>    select *

The tool also supports simple commands such as -replace, -filter, and -exclude, and offers optional color output to enhance readability.<p>Purl is a practical alternative to traditional tools like sed and grep, designed to address some of their common limitations.<p>For more information and to try purl yourself, visit: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;catatsuy&#x2F;purl"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;catatsuy&#x2F;purl</a><p>I appreciate any feedback!"

I came in believing that the best way of viewing “Agents” is an abstraction on top of multiple pipelines, such as an “Email Agent”, but Kyle presented the idea of looking at “Agents” as scoping the tools each LLM call is connected to, such as `read_email` or `calculator`. Would love to know what people think about this one, as I think getting a consensus definition of “Agents” can clarify a lot of the current confusion for people building with LLMs &#x2F; Generative AI.<p>I hope you find the podcast useful, this was such a fun one!

I&#x27;ve been hosting a small fleet of GPU servers for 3 years now on a public marketplace.<p>A couple of months ago I started building my own GPU Cloud as I believe this way users can get a better service in terms of support, reliability and functionality. Now it&#x27;s ready for the first users.<p>So why another GPU Cloud?
Well, firstly, high quality and reasonably priced cloud GPU providers are constantly out of capacity.<p>Another reason is the gripe I have with GPU marketplaces. It&#x27;s difficult to know whether the server you&#x27;re renting is in a proper data center or in someone&#x27;s hot and humid basement. This leads to reliability and performance issues which drags down the quality (and therefore the price) of the whole platform.
This incentivises building cheap unreliable servers to save on cost.<p>Additionally, the current GPU marketplaces are all focused on hosting Docker containers instead of virtual machines. This is fine for most use cases but it is a fundamental limitation. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of user complaints about not being able to run their image because of a driver&#x2F;kernel version mismatch. There are many more reasons which I could go into.<p>The goal of Backprop is to address these problems.
We&#x27;re hosted in a tier III data center. All instances are virtual machines with root access and fully dedicated IPv4 addresses. We&#x27;re reasonably priced (hopefully you agree) with no additional charges on storage&#x2F;bandwidth.<p>We currently only have RTX 3090 servers but we&#x27;re looking to expand our capacity soon.<p>Please share your feedback!<p>PS! We&#x27;re looking to build a high quality marketplace so if you know a host that meets these criteria, please get in touch!"

Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I can&#x27;t be bothered to burn a live ISO onto a USB stick. There&#x27;s initramfs, but it&#x27;s hardly a pleasant environment, with network configuration and all.<p>My go-to solution has typically been to create a chroot with busybox and a few utilities in &#x2F;tmp, chroot into it, and then kill services that use the solid drive so that I can unmount it. That&#x27;s an error-prone process, and sometimes systemd itself uses disk, so you can&#x27;t unmount the drive despite killing all the userland but PID 1.<p>This script improves the UX. It uses a Docker image as the chroot base, which is much easier to tailor to your needs, and automagically commits all the atrocities, such as tearing down all the userland processes, including PID 1, and re-spawning the host system from the container filesystem.<p>It also drives libostree and Nix users mad, because it can be used to try out a new DE or even a whole OS without polluting the host filesystem or spawning a virtual machine. The video in the README shows me trying out KDE + SDDM from a host running GNOME + GDM3."

IC at a tech megacorp (think 10k+ employees).<p>Even after 1y+ here, I continue to struggle with adapting to this environment and making myself valuable to the team&#x2F;company beyond merely completing my assigned tickets. I think I am reasonably competent at the craft of building software (writing tests and documentation, identifying code smells and antipatterns, applying design patterns and particular software programming styles where appropriate); I&#x27;m even pretty good at the bureaucratic work of filing tickets, maintaining the wiki, and writing self- and peer-evals through performance review season. But I have difficulty with being a proactive member within it: in other words, having a voice, leading initiatives, or feeling qualified to make meaningful decisions (technical or otherwise).<p>If pressed, I could describe my team&#x27;s OKRs and how my tickets move the needle on them. I could <i>not</i> describe what my teammates are working on, much less what adjacent teams are working on. There are a <i>lot</i> of design docs, architecture docs, and planning docs; I have a deluge of these tabs open, and I have a vague sense that it would be good to grok them, but when I take the time to read through them, I feel very little confidence that I understand well enough to put that knowledge to use. The only meetings I&#x27;ve ever scheduled were to ask for help getting unblocked on a ticket. I tend to drift off in meetings because people are almost always discussing things I have no context on and am not party to.<p>Can anyone recommend books that will help me engage better with the business that I work for, or get meaningful things done within it? I am not necessarily aiming for a management position, but would like to actively leverage the fact that I work in an organization: to create my own opportunities to work with people other than my manager and mentor, and in the process, to get things done for the business that is greater than the sum of us working separately."

Why?<p>As a teacher and cognitive scientist, the reason is interesting: Unix
documentation, starting with its man pages, is presented in a format
that makes it easy for experts to look up details, not for beginners
to learn concepts or build skills.  O&#x27;Reilly, Sam&#x27;s, APress and others
have built large businesses selling second-best solutions to this
problem.<p>This is a teaching anti-pattern that emerges when domain experts --
<i>but teaching novices</i> -- try to write a curriculum from scratch.
They don&#x27;t realize that teaching is a separate skill from the material
to be taught, and that a great deal of effort is needed to break a
domain down into right-sized, self-sufficient chunks for the reader to
consume.  Instead, they produce big volumes of unorganized knowledge
(man pages) that reflects <i>their expert-level understanding</i>, that the
reader tries to sift through and, as often as not, gives up on in
frustration.  Even when you pay experts to write beginner-friendly
books, you get separate books on bash, awk, sed, grep, regexes, files,
processes, packages and so on.  These put the onus on the reader to
remember all the details and put them all together into something
useful.<p>Having dumped all this information on you, I always get the feeling
that the gurus are patting you on the head and saying, &quot;Well, learning
is hard.  You have to work at it.  Be sure you practice enough and
you&#x27;ll figure it all out eventually.&quot;  Learning is not supposed to be
easy, and you do have to practice, but too often that attitude serves
as an excuse to stop looking for better teaching methods.<p>So I&#x27;d like to propose one here.<p>The interactive piece takes place on the user&#x27;s machine.  They clone a
git repository that contains lots of text files that they can
manipulate with complex commands, according to lessons and exercises
delivered via a web app.  The web app helps the user remember using a
technique I call graduated spaced repetition, which extends the basic
SuperMemo algorithm to test <i>concepts</i>, not just facts, with
progressively more elaborate questions.<p>All of this should be relatively simple to write.  The main
differentiator will be good instructional design which -- sorry if I
sound like a jerk here -- I have not seen much in evidence in the 20
years I&#x27;ve spent learning this material.<p>Which brings me to my questions for you:<p>1. I know a lot of people have already tried to do this.  Can you point to any existing learning tools that have really knocked it out of the park?<p>2. What text processing tasks do you consider absolutely essential to  Unix command line proficiency?<p>3. What kinds of text files (Natural language text, CSV, logfiles, etc) would it be useful to practice on to get there?  Where can I find some?<p>If you want to talk about building the training set or the
extensions I&#x27;ve made to the SuperMemo protocol, or if you just want to
spitball ideas, you can email me at $MY_HN_USERNAME@gmail.com"

Or is compile&#x2F;build so tool-specific that that’s all there is?<p>Here’s what I mean by tool-specific: resources about autotools require you to go into the guts of autotools. Resources about  Cmake require you to go into the guts of Cmake. Resources about Meson require you to go into the guts of Meson. Compare that with, for example, learning about memory management. You can get quite in depth introductions and overviews of memory management without necessarily needing to get into the guts of x86-64 mm. Now, you often do. But usually as an exemplar towards the end, in order to illustrate the general principles that have been established. When I have tried to approach learning about build systems, it feels like you are immediately thrown into the weeds of how specific tools work. But my interest is not necessarily in learning one specific tool in order to use it right now.<p>From the beggars <i>can</i> be choosers front: reading material preferred, podcasts ok, videos I’m meh-ish about but if that’s what exists, hit me with them."

For example there is painless (&lt;-- I hope!) zero-copy transmission of arbitrary combinations of STL-compliant native C++ data structures.<p>To help determine whether Flow-IPC is relevant to you we wrote an intro blog post. It works through an example, summarizes the available features, and has some performance results. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;flow-ipc-introductio...</a><p>Of course there&#x27;s nothing wrong with going straight to the GitHub link and getting into the README and docs.<p>Currently Flow-IPC is for Linux.

This has been going on since last July and is now approaching 10 months with no sign of the funds being released. Every time they say the will release the funds on a certain date, I get another extension on the hold.<p>I have spent countless hours trying to reach support and on the phone with their offshore reps but there has been no update on this situation. They have asked 4 different times for &quot;more information&quot; on my business which every single time I make sure to give them everything they ask for and also outline exactly what my business does in great detail. At one point they had reduced the reserve to 10% instead of 25% but it only stayed like that for 3 weeks before they bumped it back to 25%. This made no sense to me.<p>We make just enough profit to cover overheads and vendor costs but I have now gone out of pocket to cover payroll and this is no longer going to be sustainable for me. Does anyone have any good experiences with similar situations or could point in the right direction to getting this resolved? Any help or feedback would be much appreciated."

I can only imagine the complexities they have to deal with, and at the same time there is a potential negative monetary impact. Valve makes boat loads of $$ from Counter-Strike through skins for weapons and models. It is its own economy. Banning people, even though they are cheaters, is money lost.<p>Furthermore, some of the solutions to deal with cheaters are to play on 3rd party services (i.e. FACEIT) that require you to install an &quot;anti-cheat&quot; that gives kernel level access and is owned by some questionable folks (I won&#x27;t get into the details of that you can do your own research).<p>That brings us to GamingHerd. For now, my idea is to be Google for PC video game cheaters, smurfs (read this about smurfs <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idnow.io&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;smurfing&#x2F;#:~:text=What%20is%20Smurfing%20in%20gaming,alternate%20account%20or%20multiple%20accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idnow.io&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;smurfing&#x2F;#:~:text=What%20is%20...</a>.), racists, throwers, etc. People you do not want to play video games with. Let me tell you, there are a lot, unfortunately.<p>Currently, I am working to grow this into a community and build a matchmaking service around it. The matchmaking would obviously utilize the Toxic Gaming DB (TGDB) to never allow them to use the service. I&#x27;ll also have community-driven moderation, you can read a bit more about that <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slash-lathe-f55.notion.site&#x2F;GamingHerd-moderation-overview-230a8966544947a796d9de389405c9e6"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slash-lathe-f55.notion.site&#x2F;GamingHerd-moderation-ov...</a>. In the perfect world this is a community of trusted gamers that you want to play video games with.<p>Let me know what you all think. Look forward to your feedback.<p>Cheers,
