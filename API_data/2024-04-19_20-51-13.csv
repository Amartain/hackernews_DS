Do it this weekend for S24,story,,"(Usually I put an &quot;Apply to YC&quot; thing in the HN footer [1] but I forgot this time, so here is my pitch to make up for it.)<p>If you&#x27;ve ever thought about applying to YC, here&#x27;s a tip: just do it. It doesn&#x27;t take long and could change your life, like it did for me and many others.<p>In particular, if you have either of these two bogus thoughts, ignore them pronto and just go to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com</a> and apply:<p>(1) &quot;probably not good enough &#x2F; won&#x27;t get in&quot; - you&#x27;d be surprised at how many people feel that way, whether because of impostor syndrome, lack of credentials, whatever—and often they turn out to be among the best founders. So this a terrible reason not to apply!<p>The nice thing is, it&#x27;s YC&#x27;s job to evaluate that, not yours. They&#x27;re looking for aptitude which doesn&#x27;t look like what most people (probably including you) assume. You needn&#x27;t look impressive, and you don&#x27;t have to be a competent founder—you learn that from doing YC. Just be yourself as you are, fill out the application and don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>(2) &quot;too early&quot; - there&#x27;s no such thing. YC looks for good potential founders—meaning anyone who can learn what they teach—and nothing else. You&#x27;re already yourself, which is all you need.<p>Some of YC&#x27;s big successes start off as last-minute applications on a whim; and many start with totally different ideas than what ends up succeeding. It&#x27;s YC&#x27;s job to teach you how to develop in the startup way, and that can start at any time.<p>(&quot;Too far along already&quot; is another bogus notion but I&#x27;ll stick with the top 2 for today.)<p>If you know the game Snakes and Ladders [2], YC is a massive ladder in an area where there are no snakes. Sure it&#x27;s a dice roll, but what reason do you have not to? If you&#x27;re uninterested in the game, no problem—but if you have any impulse to participate, do it! If you&#x27;re the &quot;out of nowhere&quot; type of founder YC loves to fund, your chances are likely a lot better than you imagine.<p>Apply by 8pm PT on Monday 4&#x2F;22 to get a decision by May 29: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.ycombinator.com</a>.<p>---<p>[1] like last October - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20231011022307&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20231011022307&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycom...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snakes_and_ladders"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snakes_and_ladders</a>"

Unlike any sane person who would go become a professor or make a gazillion dollars in industry, I decided to try bootstrapping my own software business. This is my first product.<p>The inspiration was from my research on computers understanding social norms. When ChatGPT came out, I was amazed how well it could understand social etiquette. I thought it&#x27;d be fun to make a game where you have to talk your way out of sticky situations - like you miss your friend&#x27;s birthday party, or your boss catches you trying to leave work at 2pm.<p>I made a prototype in a couple days, and it was super fun to play with. I thought I&#x27;d spend a &quot;couple months&quot; making a game for others to play online. Now, only 10 months and 923.3 hours of work later, it&#x27;s playable in early access.<p>In the game, you talk out loud (ASR), and the NPCs (LLM + TTS) talk back at you. It is fun to play with a friend! And because it&#x27;s just talking, non-gamers do great, often better than gamers.<p>I really want to have a free demo, but no time yet to implement. For now, it&#x27;s purchase only ($4.99). If anyone decides to try it, I&#x27;d really love to get more feedback. It was an enormous learning experience, especially targeting the web - so many partially supported web APIs and browser inconsistencies! Still feels like 2008 in some ways.<p>Also happy to answer questions of course. Thanks, and enjoy the weekend!"

We’ve built a walk-away benchtop sample prep system that comes preloaded with apps that require no user programming or optimization, enabling labs to maximize resources, scale sample throughput, and reduce risks related to manual handling. I filmed a quick video in the lab if you want to see what it looks like IRL: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;935960826&#x2F;d0efdf3f14"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;935960826&#x2F;d0efdf3f14</a>.<p>Sample prep is the process of going from raw biological samples to sequenceable molecules. The process typically involves isolating nucleic acids from samples like blood&#x2F;cells, breaking up these nucleic acids into small pieces, and adding barcodes at a molecular level.<p>Although sequencing technologies have made huge advancements in general, sample preparation is largely still done manually and remains a bottleneck. Many companies, small and large, have attempted to develop solutions that haven’t panned out. A couple things make it so challenging:<p>(1) The number of sample types -  for humans alone, sample types include blood, saliva, various tissue types, buccal swab, etc. Each has its own requirements when it comes to handling to isolate nucleic acids, and even within each type there are significant differences. For example, blood from various donors has different cell density.<p>(2) There is a large array of chemistries for different analyses and sequencing technologies, and there is a need for flexibility in throughputs to process a few samples at a time or run large batches.<p>Developing a technology that is flexible enough to work with various sample types and chemistries while maintaining quality spans many disciplines: fluidic dynamics, thermal engineering, molecular biology, material science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and software engineering.<p>I didn’t set out to develop a way to automate sample prep. I was exploring the use of electrowetting to manipulate colored droplets on a circuit board during my research in the MIT Media Lab. During one of my demos, there was huge interest from biologists at the lab as well as from biotech&#x2F;pharma sponsors. I quickly began to realize that the application of this technology and the potential impact it could have was much larger than I had anticipated. I immediately got to work studying biology, focusing on five broad markets that included DNA sequencing and synthetic biology. The opportunity in the well-established DNA sequencing market begging for a solution to improve the quality of samples, reduce costs and create throughput flexibility led me to developing a way to automate sample prep. And here we are today, bringing it to market.<p>The Callisto Sample Prep System is a sequencer-agnostic benchtop system that enables a push-button, walkaway sample prep experience. This enables all labs—labs already using sequencing automation, and those new to sequencing—to free up resources and not rely on skilled labor to maximize throughput. By automating the process end to end, reliably, scientists can focus on other aspects of research and development.<p>What exactly does the instrument do? It manipulates little droplets on a surface using electric and magnetic fields. These droplets contain DNA, RNA, enzymes and other biochemistries, or they can be raw samples such as blood, saliva, etc. Once these droplets are on the surface, we move, merge, mix and split them in various ways. We also incubate these samples to specific temperatures on the same surface. We also use traditional robotic technologies such as gantry and pipettors for a limited set of operations.<p>Our approach has many advantages over existing technologies: it allows us to reduce total cost to our customers with less plastic waste and reagent usage; it improves quality of samples prepared; it provides reliable sample manipulation given the electric and magnetic nature of the technology; and it offers complete walk-away automation, bringing the push-button experience of a sequencer to sample prep.<p>I’m proud to bring a solution to the market that is accessible for all labs, especially labs with lower budgets (which are the majority). Now small core labs can provide low-cost, competitive solutions relative to commercial service providers, and larger labs can scale up their processes to make new sequencing technologies available to their customers. Individual labs at universities can now bring sequencers in-house for cost-effective, efficient, and reliable sequencing. So many applications, with huge potential impact for consumers!<p>Fewer than 5M humans have so far been exposed directly to sequencing technologies, yet sequencing technologies and life sciences tool development is what propels the modern world of biology. The only other field that has experienced advancements faster than sequencing technologies over the past two decades is AI, if that gives a basis of comparison for how big this is.<p>This level of sample prep automation is new to genomics, new to the world! I’m excited to hear your comments, questions, thoughts, ideas  - please share your insights and experiences to help us realize the full potential of this technology and make a tangible impact on science and society. And, go!"

We are excited to announce the second release of Desbordante — an open-source, high-performance data profiler that is capable of discovering and validating many different patterns in data using various algorithms.<p>Unlike existing data profilers, Desbordante focuses on discovering complex patterns in data, which are notoriously hard to extract. Since its inception in 2019, it has become the fastest open-source tool for these tasks. It also offers an array of patterns which have no alternative implementations. With this release, Desbordante now supports 17 types of patterns, such as: various types of functional dependencies, inclusion and order dependencies, fuzzy algebraic constraints and many others.<p>Some ways in which Desbordante can be helpful are:
1) Hypothesis generation for scientists that work with large volumes of data.
2) Business data owners and business analysts can benefit from hypothesis generation as well as data quality improvement: cleaning databases from errors, finding and removing inexact duplicates, and so on.
3) Found primitives can help data scientists in feature engineering and choosing the right direction for ablation studies.<p>Desbordante solves two types of tasks: Discovery and Validation. The Discovery task is designed to identify all instances of a specified pattern type of a given dataset. The Validation task is different: it is designed to check whether a specified pattern instance is present in a given dataset. This task not only returns True or False, but it also explains why the instance does not hold (e.g. it can list table rows with conflicting values).<p>Desbordante offers a CLI, a web application, and a Python library. The latter makes it possible to construct ad-hoc data analysis pipelines — essentially, your own applications for various data quality tasks: data cleaning, data deduplication, anomaly detection, data schema recovery and many others. You can check out example implementations here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Desbordante&#x2F;desbordante-core&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Desbordante&#x2F;desbordante-core&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;ex...</a>.<p>Check out some of our articles for more details:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@chernishev&#x2F;exploratory-data-analysis-with-desbordante-4b97299cce07"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@chernishev&#x2F;exploratory-data-analysis-wit...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itnext.io&#x2F;building-a-simple-data-cleaning-application-with-desbordante-e4897dcd4c5d"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itnext.io&#x2F;building-a-simple-data-cleaning-applicatio...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levelup.gitconnected.com&#x2F;checking-mining-and-exploring-functional-dependencies-in-python-903bb0e26d5d"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levelup.gitconnected.com&#x2F;checking-mining-and-explori...</a><p>This major release brings a lot of improvements: support for several novel patterns, support for novel data type — graphs, added python bindings for existing patterns, better guides and examples and more.

The mmul approximation itself can be pushed to run 2x fast before the quality of output collapses.<p>The inference speed is just a bit faster than Llama.cpp&#x27;s, because the rest of implementation could be better, but with a better development I think it can be a new method to speed up inference - in addition to quantization.<p>You could call it ad-hoc model distillation :)<p>You can change the speed &#x2F; accuracy of a model at will, in real time.<p>Oh, and as a side effect, the data format allows to also choose how much of the model you want to load into the memory. You can decide to skip say 10-20-40% of the least important weights.<p>It&#x27;s implemented for Mistral, it was also tested slightly on Mixtral and Llama. It&#x27;s for FP16 for now, but Q8 is in the works.<p>The algorithm is described here, and the implementation is open source.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolinko.github.io&#x2F;effort&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolinko.github.io&#x2F;effort&#x2F;</a><p>I know these are bold claims, but I hope they survive the scrutiny :)"

Like many of you, for my entire career I have relied on Homebrew to install all kinds of software on my Mac. That&#x27;s why today I&#x27;m really excited to share a new app that my partner and I are building: Brewer X, a refreshing user interface for Homebrew.<p>Brewer X is graphical interface that lives on top of Homebrew. Leveraging the power of native APIs improves the classic experience and unlocks new features. For example:<p>• bulk actions are performed in parallel<p>• syncing the entire library locally provides incredible search performances and the ability to query descriptions and other previously unaccessible fields<p>• maintenance scripts run automatically for you<p>• last but not least... app icons (or favicons when not available) let you quickly identify what you&#x27;re looking for<p>The app is written in Swift and uses only AppKit with Nib files for top performance, pixel perfect design, and maximum flexibility.<p>We also designed the app icon and all the others in the UI ourselves. Following the great insights from Sketch[^1] we managed to make them super crispy. We&#x27;re also very proud to have been featured in the macOS App Icon Book[^2].<p>The app has only been out for a couple of weeks, but we&#x27;ve already seen an amazing response from the community. We can&#x27;t tell you all of our future plans yet, but here&#x27;s a list of things we&#x27;d like to see in the app in the near future:<p>• Import&#x2F;Export<p>• Automatic replacement of apps installed without Homebrew<p>• Notifications about available updates<p>• Finder actions<p>• Spotlight integration<p>I hope you find Brewer X interesting. We&#x27;re happy to answer any question!<p>[^1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sketch.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-redesigned-our-toolbar-icons-for-big-sur-and-monterey&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sketch.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-redesigned-our-toolbar-ic...</a><p>[^2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appiconbook.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appiconbook.com&#x2F;</a>"

(It is 100% self-published, not endorsed by Google.)<p>So… I wrote a book. It’s a different book with a unique approach. It’s not a novel or a technical book. It’s a biography, a company’s biography. My hope is that it serves two purposes: to inspire founders and to captivate interior designers.<p>It all started three years ago. My wife and I were discussing interior design for our living room and she brought up what beautiful coffee table books should we have. After looking at her favorites I realized there’s nothing like this for tech startups. Digital products are intangible, how cool would it be to make them tangible and a beautiful art&#x2F;decor book for your home office or living room?<p>This idea of consolidating my particular interests with my wife’s decorative goals got stuck in the back of my head for a while. I searched and searched. I could only find these kinds of books related to design, architecture, fashion, or travel. Nothing about tech startups. The next logical step for me was to do it myself…<p>And oh… what a “mistake” it was. This whole project was done during nights and weekends - the first half while working on my startup and the last half while helping create Webflow Labs. You have no idea how many times I “quit” the project. In the end, perseverance and discipline were key to making it happen.<p>During my founder journey, I collected several notes about successful (and unsuccessful) tech startups to help me learn from them. I decided to write about Google’s fascinating story: a true generational company and one of the most valuable companies in the world.<p>It’s with great pleasure and satisfaction that I’m introducing you to “Google - First 25 Years”. A book celebrating the minds behind the tech giant&#x27;s incredible journey from Stanford to global dominance.<p>I have absolutely no idea if this book’s format and concept make sense or if it has an audience willing to invest ($169). Here are some of the unique features:<p>▪ Silk hardcover<p>▪ Limited edition<p>▪ Handpainted edges<p>▪ More than 30 handmade illustrations<p>I’m producing only 1,000 copies. If the book concept seems interesting enough, leave a comment, I’d love to know your thoughts!<p>Either way, this project was a super fun ride where being outside my comfort zone was the best way to learn storytelling, graphic design, and product manufacturing.<p>At least, I hope this inspires you to go back to your side projects and finish them!"

Finally, I trained a 30 million parameter model on 1 billion tokens and deployed it as a web service.
You can access the LLM using this site - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kunalmishra.info"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kunalmishra.info</a><p>The following steps were taken to build Tiny Tales GPT
1. Downloaded and preprocessed 8GB of dataset using multiprocessing library.
2. Tokenized the data using byte pair encoding to create 1 billion tokens sharded in different bin files.
3. Defined a training setup and trained the model on a small version of the LLaMA model architecture with 30 million parameters.
4. The training was done using Distributed Data-Parallel on two A-100 GPUs provided by JarvisLabs.ai (they are most cost-optimized)
5. After the training is done, an inference script is created to predict the tokens from the trained model given the input context vector.
6. Developed REST-based API service using Flask framework to interact with the inference service to the end user.
7. Finally used GCP&#x27;s virtual machines, instance groups, load balancers, and DNS services to deploy the service on the internet."

- Infra to handle running many crawling jobs
- Proxying, hosting headless browsers at scale
- Conversion to clean markdown
- Caching

Just curious on how applicable deep learning theory knowledge is in the practical setting? Based on my very limited amount of conversation with people in my university, career fairs, and online information, what I get from them is that a lot of the hyperparameter selection decisions comes from the engineer&#x27;s intuition and past experience. Trying to combine my knowledge of statistics and some deep learning theory survey that I&#x27;ve tried my best to understand, it seems to be possible to come up with a rigorous and procedural way (something that could be streamlined) to determine hyperparameters and possible architectures if we know certain properties of the dataset and intended task.<p>Is the theory good enough for the practical applications? (by practical I don&#x27;t mean large scale projects that Google or OpenAI does. More of just small companies who seek to apply established methodologies on their own dataset). If yes, then do people actually do this? If no, can I have more of your thoughts on why?"

We focus on fraud prevention at signup and login (preventing multi-accounting and account theft), but some customers were concerned about post-login security and asked us to add a session hijacking prevention feature to our fraud prevention API. In the end, we decided to just implement a solution in Javascript. We call it session-lock, and it can be used today across all browsers[2] and, theoretically, native mobile apps.<p>For a more comprehensive writeup and quick demo, you can visit the link. In short, the library adds a device-bound signature to the session token each time it’s used. At login, it creates a signing key pair on the browser using SubtleCrypto, with the private key set as “unextractable” and stored in IndexedDB (this forms the basis of its device-binding). Also at login, the public key is sent to the server along with the user’s credentials. If the credentials are valid, the server adds the public key to the payload of the JWT it returns to the client. When the client uses the JWT to access a protected resource, session-lock adds a signature to the end of it, along with a timestamp to mitigate replay attack risk. The server then validates the signature using the public key embedded in the JWT. The private key must be removed from IndexedDB upon logout.<p>While Chrome’s DBSC would be a nice solution when it gets around to being deployed in Chrome and Edge, I think session-lock would help a lot today across all browsers in countering common attacks like malicious browser extensions that rip LocalStorage and cookies. Also, implementing the general flow in native mobile apps[3] would have the same key advantages as DBSC - compiled code already on the device and utilization of hardware TPMs.<p>Aside from JS tampering and extracting “unextractable” CryptoKeys from IndexedDB, please let me know if you can think of any other potential attacks. Happy to answer any questions.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;04&#x2F;fighting-cookie-theft-usin...</a>

Also, many gas boilers have capability to run more efficiently but are not configured to.<p>This particular boiler does not seem to respect the MM=0 command (despite OpenTherm&#x27;s such specification requirement) which is not uncommon. SAT sends the MM=0 command for the boiler to work at its minimum capacity. CS= minimum_setpoint and then PWM controls the ON&#x2F;OFF times of the boiler. However, I have a workaround which ensures that most of the time, the boiler is indeed working at its minimum modulation, unless the target flow (heating curve + PID) demand is high [higher than current flow temperature] during warm up.<p>The boiler supplies heat to the central heating and domestic hot water tank, but not at the same time. The hot water tank capacity is 255 litres. When DHW call is made, boiler ignores OpenTherm instructions and runs at 80 C degrees. There are three zone valves in the house: Hot Water, Upstairs and Downstairs (not talking about TRVs here). When DHW call is made, Hot Water valve opens, and Upstairs &amp; Downstairs close; then if CH call is made, Hot Water valve closes and the other two open.<p>The hot water system is also fitted with &quot;Waste Water Heat Recovery System&quot;. In essence, the heat energy extracted from showers and baths is used to preheat cold water that is then sent to the hot water tank. The extraction recovers about 60% of heat normally lost. You can watch examples of how it works here - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G-jKlCoRvEM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G-jKlCoRvEM</a><p>SAT project - the brain behind the efficiency
