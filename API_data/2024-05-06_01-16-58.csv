This rewrite threw all of that out, and goes much, much further:<p>you just want to have the plane take off without having to do anything? Check, this tutorial covers auto-takeoff.<p>Flying with waypoint-based navigation, not by &quot;programming airports and radio beacons one letter at a time with a jog-dial&quot; but by just placing markers on a map and dragging those around as you please, mid-flight, Google Maps style? Check. After all, why would we not, putting a map on a webpage is super easy (barely an inconvenience).<p>In fact, let&#x27;s throw in flight plan saving and loading, so others can fly the same route!<p>And maybe you want the plane to fly a fixed distance above the ground, instead of at a fixed altitude... well: check. You&#x27;ll learn about terrain-follow using free Digital Elevation Model datasets for planet Earth.<p>And of course the big one, for the ultimate &quot;click button, JS flies the plane start to finish&quot; experience: ever wished the in-game autopilot could just land the plane for you? Well, it&#x27;s a video game, and we know programming, so: why not? We&#x27;re also implementing auto-landing and it&#x27;s going to be amazing.<p>If you play MSFS, and you&#x27;re a developer&#x2F;programmer, and you&#x27;ve always thought how cool it would be if you could just do some scripting for it... you can, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of cool stuff you can do!<p>And of course if you don&#x27;t want to follow along and just want to have everything set up and ready to fly your plane, just clone <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pomax&#x2F;are-we-flying</a> and have fun."

We are also trying to make it more no-nonsense (no hidden fees, no H100 behind “contact sales”, etc.).<p>The tech to make this work is actually kind of nifty, we may do an in-depth HN post on that soon.<p>Right now, we have H100s, a few RTX 4090s and a GTX 1080 Ti online. Feel free to try it out!<p>Also, if you’ve got compute sitting around (a GPU cluster, a crypto mining operation or just a GPU) or if you’re an AI company with idle compute (hopefully not in a Stability AI way) and want to see some ROI, it’s very simple and flexible to hook it up to our site and you’ll maybe get a few researchers using your compute.<p>Nice rest of the week!"

And that sparked my curiosity with this question, what is considered affordable hardware for running large language models locally today? I&#x27;m aware that there&#x27;s a lot of work underway to make inference cheap to run at the edge but I&#x27;m curious to understand the landscape at present that anyone could purchase. I seen people running models on flagship smartphones but those are more expensive then a mac mini with worse performance.<p>By affordable I mean no greater then the cost of a current gen base model mac mini ($599) but ideally around the price of a raspberry pi 5 ($79) which when searching for budget PC gets mentioned[2]. Both devices have the same amount of ram in my case (8gb) but different performance observed given the importance of memory bandwidth. I mention these two because I&#x27;ve had experience running llama 3 via ollama on both with success although of slower speeds compared to a full workstation with a commodity GPU i.e. RTX 4090 which starts at ($1599). I&#x27;m interested in learning about what other devices are out there that people consider cheap and use for LLMs locally.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38646969<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;picks&#x2F;the-best-budget-desktop-computers"

Take a look at our demo and give it a try on your emails at: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IST-DASLab&#x2F;PanzaMail"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IST-DASLab&#x2F;PanzaMail</a><p>Some technical details about Panza:<p>- Panza is an automated email assistant customized to your writing style and past email history.<p>- Panza produces a fine-tuned LLM that matches your writing style, pairing it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) component which helps it produce relevant emails.<p>- Panza *can be trained and run entirely locally*. Currently, it requires a single GPU with 16-24 GiB of memory, but we also plan to release a CPU-only version.<p>- Training and execution are also quick - for a dataset on the order of 1000 emails, training Panza takes well under an hour, and generating a new email takes a few seconds at most."

Type a keyword or a description of what you&#x27;re interested in, and you&#x27;ll get top links from HN surfaced to you along with brief summaries.<p>Unlike HN&#x27;s otherwise very valuable search feature, Hacker Search doesn&#x27;t require you to get your keywords exactly right. That&#x27;s achieved by leveraging OpenAI&#x27;s latest embedding models alongside more traditional indexes extracted from the scraped and cleaned up contents of the links.<p>I think there are many more interesting things one could build atop the HN dataset in the age of LLMs (e.g. more explicitly searching for technical opinions, recommending stories to you based on your interests, and making the core search feature more useful). If any of those sound interesting to you, head over to <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackersearch.net&#x2F;signup"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackersearch.net&#x2F;signup</a> to get notified when I launch them!<p>Note: at least one person has built something similar before (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36391655"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36391655</a>).

I’ll find myself nearly word-for-word copying the information I need. This is a habit from my years in education where I would basically transcribe lectures as a way to maintain attention as a strategy for ADHD. Therefore, my notes end up a muddled version of the source material and I’ll just use the source material for reference, making the initial note take a big waste of time from the standpoint of having an easy reference available.<p>Another problem I run into is that when I’m very attentive to a task or piece of information and want to take some note on it or reference notes from elsewhere, switching contexts to my notes is disruptive.<p>Are there any resources you recommend for effective note-taking?"
