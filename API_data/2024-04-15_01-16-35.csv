Gabriel_h,,40034480,,1,1713128745,Meticulous (YC S21) is hiring to eliminate E2E UI tests,job,,"Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a>.<p>Meticulous is a tool which creates and maintains a suite of e2e tests that exhaustively covers your web application - without any developer intervention whatsoever. We’ve also eliminated flaky tests (really!). No flakes. The tech behind this is fascinating.<p>Meticulous passively records sessions and uses these to generate a comprehensive test suite.<p>Our customers love the product and rely on meticulous.ai (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a>) as the sole system for testing their frontend. Here’s what they say:<p>“Once you start using Meticulous, you won’t want to stop. It provides confidence without the effort of writing and maintaining tests. I love the tight feedback loop of seeing a visual confirmation of my changes, and any unwanted side effects.” - Joel, engineer at Patchwork Health<p>“Meticulous eliminated the need to write and maintain frontend tests across my engineering organization. One of the most exciting DevTools on the market today.” - Seth, CTO at Courier<p>We trust Meticulous to be the sole front-end testing system for our app. It has caught countless UI bugs and regressions without us having to write a single test. This coverage saves us time and gives us confidence to move quickly.” - Nick, engineer at WithPower<p>How does Meticulous work?<p>Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch regressions before they hit production. It catches logical, behavioral and visual issues. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meticulous.ai&#x2F;?utm_source=hn</a><p>What’s our team like?<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir, GitHub and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of six. We sponsor visas.<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.
- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.
- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar. 
- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.<p>What we look for:<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.<p>We&#x27;re currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.<p>You can read about our values here <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site&#x2F;Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a><p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world&#x27;s leading tech companies).<p>You’ll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with “HN” in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume&#x2F;LinkedIn&#x2F;GitHub."

We made it because we like to put apps into production quickly, and authentication &amp; user management was taking up way too much time.<p>We have components like &lt;SignIn &#x2F;&gt; and &lt;AccountSettings &#x2F;&gt; that automatically adapt to whatever theme &amp; design system you&#x27;re using. Check the blog post to see the example with Radix UI and Joy UI.<p>Also, there&#x27;s an admin dashboard for monitoring and editing accounts.

For example, for this table:<p><pre><code>    create table book(
      id int primary key,
      title text not null
    );
</code></pre>
You can run `index_advisor()` to see if there should be an index on a select statement:<p><pre><code>    select *
    from index_advisor(&#x27;select book.id from book where title = $1&#x27;);
</code></pre>
And it will return (summarized):<p><pre><code>    {&quot;CREATE INDEX ON public.book USING btree (title)&quot;}
</code></pre>
It works particularly well with pg_stat_statements[0] which tracks execution statistics of all SQL statements executed on your Postgres database.<p>It leans heavily on HypoPG[1], an excellent extension to determine if PostgreSQL will use a given index without spending resources to create them.<p>[0] pg_stat_statements: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;pgstatstatements.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;current&#x2F;pgstatstatements.htm...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HypoPG&#x2F;hypopg"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HypoPG&#x2F;hypopg</a>"

Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.<p>Looking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you&#x27;ve figured them out!<p>Oh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you&#x27;ll see -- it&#x27;s such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library."

Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I can&#x27;t be bothered to burn a live ISO onto a USB stick. There&#x27;s initramfs, but it&#x27;s hardly a pleasant environment, with network configuration and all.<p>My go-to solution has typically been to create a chroot with busybox and a few utilities in &#x2F;tmp, chroot into it, and then kill services that use the solid drive so that I can unmount it. That&#x27;s an error-prone process, and sometimes systemd itself uses disk, so you can&#x27;t unmount the drive despite killing all the userland but PID 1.<p>This script improves the UX. It uses a Docker image as the chroot base, which is much easier to tailor to your needs, and automagically commits all the atrocities, such as tearing down all the userland processes, including PID 1, and re-spawning the host system from the container filesystem.<p>It also drives libostree and Nix users mad, because it can be used to try out a new DE or even a whole OS without polluting the host filesystem or spawning a virtual machine.

Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can&#x27;t redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK, though.)<p>Cheers and happy weekend!"

Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google&#x27;s SDK requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic, configure it in the console, and understand the documentation (which is quite shallow, by the way).<p>Anyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into &quot;realtime APIs&quot; with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.<p>Since it&#x27;s a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear your opinions. It&#x27;s still quite primitive, but the basic features already work.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zerosheets.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zerosheets.com</a>"

It’s an educational platform that provides an in-browser code editor and execution environment. The idea is to make teaching programming easier by eliminating the technical barriers that educators and students often face.<p>Feature highlights:
* In-Browser coding: Write, run, and debug code directly in your browser. No more downloading software, configuring environments, and resolving compatibility issues.
* Course management: Manage classes, assignments, and student interactions in one place.
* Many languages supported: Python, Java, JavaScript, C&#x2F;C++, C#, Go, PHP – more incoming.<p>Open beta access: I’d love it if interested people could join my open beta, explore the platform&#x27;s capabilities, and provide some feedback to help me make it a better tool.<p>Thank you for your time!<p>Contact: support@classroomio.app"

Ours is interesting because it&#x27;s a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;</a><p>Others do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;descriptinc&#x2F;descript-audio-codec"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;descriptinc&#x2F;descript-audio-codec</a>) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion model is also particularly interesting because it is the first audio diffusion model to generate coherent lyrics!<p>We like diffusion models for music generation because they have some interesting properties that make controlling them easier (so you can make <i>your own</i> music instead of just taking what the machine gives you). For example, we have a rhythm control mode where you can upload your own percussion line or set a BPM. Very soon you&#x27;ll also be able to generate proper variations of an uploaded or previously generated song (e.g., you could even sing into Voice Memos for a minute and upload that!). @Musicians of HN, try uploading your songs and using Rhythm Control&#x2F;let us know what you think! Our goal is to enable more of you, not replace you.<p>For example, we turned this drum line (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz</a>) into this full song (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7</a> skip to 1:05 if impatient) or this other song I like better (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins</a> - we accidentally compressed it with AAC instead of Opus which hurt quality, though)<p>We also like diffusion models because while they&#x27;re expensive to train, they&#x27;re cheap to serve. We built our own efficient inference infrastructure instead of using those expensive inference as a service startups that are all the rage. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re making generations on our site free and unlimited for as long as possible.<p>We&#x27;d love to answer your questions. Let us know what you think of our first model! <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;</a>"

Or is compile&#x2F;build so tool-specific that that’s all there is?<p>Here’s what I mean by tool-specific: resources about autotools require you to go into the guts of autotools. Resources about  Cmake require you to go into the guts of Cmake. Resources about Meson require you to go into the guts of Meson. Compare that with, for example, learning about memory management. You can get quite in depth introductions and overviews of memory management without necessarily needing to get into the guts of x86-64 mm. Now, you often do. But usually as an exemplar towards the end, in order to illustrate the general principles that have been established. When I have tried to approach learning about build systems, it feels like you are immediately thrown into the weeds of how specific tools work. But my interest is not necessarily in learning one specific tool in order to use it right now.<p>From the beggars <i>can</i> be choosers front: reading material preferred, podcasts ok, videos I’m meh-ish about but if that’s what exists, hit me with them."

Annotate lets you create step-by-step code walkthroughs, inspired by Stripe’s documentation (e.g., <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stripe.com&#x2F;checkout&#x2F;quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stripe.com&#x2F;checkout&#x2F;quickstart</a>) for your technical product. It comes with a React SDK that lets you  embed walkthroughs directly in your docs or marketing materials. Check out an example walkthrough on the home page.<p>Why build Annotate? I’ve been in the dev tooling space for the last 5 years and have two main learnings:<p>1. Developers first look for a quick start guide when exploring a technical product. A great quick start increase developer adoption.<p>2. Developers typically prefer code snippets that closely resemble real-world applications over traditional longer-form docs.<p>Annotate helps you solve both above points.<p>Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!"

An important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with a machine. What happens when that&#x27;s the case? Would people enjoy companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?<p>Whatever the answers, I can&#x27;t shake away the feeling that human uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of meaning.

I want to share a spreadsheet tool we are building. The main idea is to be able to specify logic for a no code tool inside a spreadsheet. We have automations, data integration,  action formulas, dashboards.<p>Linked example: We use our UPDATECELL formula to make a step in a board of game of life. We can also use CHAIN to make it run indefinitely. The actions are exposed as buttons in a dashboard.<p>Our automations work by loading your spreadsheet on the server and running an action specified in  the spreadsheet. So the logic could be, pull in data from google sheet, send a personalized email to every row which we haven’t emailed yet, mark those rows as complete. Run this automation on 5 minute schedule, add any other custom logic you need (e.g. test email for deliverability) and you have yourself an automatic email tool.<p>We are leaning into automations to differentiate ourselves from other products in the field at the moment.<p>Technical kinks:<p>- Since our automations make changes to the spreadsheet, we needed a robust multiplayer system. We implemented a CRDT system. This is a topic for a longer blog post, but one fun challenge was to implement CRDT for rows&#x2F;column which allowed for adding&#x2F;deleting&#x2F;reordering performantly while preserving most user intent in the case of offline editing.
- Some of our formulas are inherently asynchronous; for example those which fetch data from an external data source. That added an extra kink when writing the spreadsheet engine; e.g. topologically sorting and then evaluating in order can cause you to get stuck on a long running evaluation.
- One of our premises is that we do not store your data; it gets pulled when the spreadsheet evaluates. That means everything reevaluates in the browser when you open a spreadsheet. Get this to be performant (we still have a long way to go) was a challenge. Currently, everything runs in a single worker.<p>Let me know what you all think."

Anyone else disappointed?,story,,"My take:<p>* EVERYTHING was about Gemini (Google&#x27;s generative AI).  It became the running joke in the hallways and tram and eating area.  News flash: not everything needs or is approprite for gen ai.  So at this conference, anything not related to gen AI was left out.  There&#x27;s a talk about XYZ?   No.  There&#x27;s a talk about shoehorning gen ai into XYZ.<p>* So. Much. Marketing.  I&#x27;m a technical person.  I want technical details.  I want A LOT of technical details.  I need to know how different products interact with other products and what the limitations are so that I can actaully plan out how to use your product.  But there was only high-level marketing information given most of the time, so it was a complete waste of time.  Don&#x27;t forget the gen ai....<p>* The demonstrations often fell into two camps: cringey and useless (not mutually exclusive).  Of course these talks are practiced, but it&#x27;s obvious when someone is reading from a script.  Just don&#x27;t.  They were mostly useless, though, because they didn&#x27;t give any technical details or, when they did, the code was so small that it was unreadable.  The guy next to me tried to use his phone as binoculars to zoom in, but then it was still blurry.  You have a 30 foot screen... why is your code in 10% of it, and the rest is whitespace?  That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s because your whole UI has too much whitespace, too.  (Really... just look a the BigQuery studio screen, for example, and notice how much of the page is taken up by useless, non-collapsable whitespace!)<p>* The app just didn&#x27;t work sometimes.  The app didn&#x27;t transfer your &quot;likes&quot; from the website.  The app made it cumbersome to find out exactly where things were located on the map.  There was no direct link, so you had to back out of one area of the app to get into the map, only to find that the name didn&#x27;t match up directly, so now I had to back out of the map and re-find the thing that I was looking for, simply to have to back out of it again and re-navigate to the map.  Yeah.<p>* One.  There was exactly one talk that I went to that had any value whatsoever.  I&#x27;m glad that I went to it, but out of 3 days of conference talks, to only find one talk (on the 3rd day) that wasn&#x27;t a waste of time was, in a word, disappointing.  Other coworkers also found a talk that they really appreciated (we went to different talks because of the overlap), but that means that it was pretty much impossible for a single person to find multiple talks of value.  It&#x27;s all a gamble (which I suppose is why the conference was in Las Vegas).<p>* The expo.  That was the best part, because Google had their actual engineers there, and they were pleasant enough and polite enough to answer pointed, technical questions.  They were not marked.  I found the first one by talking to someone, who sent me somewhere else, and that person sent me to a different place, but I eventually found them, and it was amazing!  They were then able to point me to other people who could answer questions about other products that I use.<p>* In short: too much advertizing, not enough technical.  Too much &quot;this is what we want you to know about Google&#x27;s gen AI&quot; and not enough &quot;this will help you to better use out product.&quot;<p>Am I alone?  Am I simply jaded?"

I added it to the repo for reference.<p>When it clicked in my head that &quot;knowing a fact&quot; is nearly synonymous with predicting a word (or series of words), I wanted to put it to the test, because it seemed so simple. I chose JavaScript because I can exploit the way it structures objects to aid in the modeling of language.<p>For example:<p>&quot;I want to be at the beach&quot;, 
&quot;I will do it later&quot;, 
&quot;I want to know the answer&quot;, 
...<p>becomes:<p><pre><code>  {
    I: { 
      want: { 
        to: { 
          be: { ... }, 
          know: { ... }
        }
      },
      will: { ... }
    },
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
in JavaScript. You can exploit the language&#x27;s fast object lookup speed to find known sentences this way, rather than recursively searching text - which is the convention and would take forever or not work at all considering there are several full books loaded in by default (and it could support many more).<p>Accompanying research yielded learnings about what &quot;tokens&quot; and &quot;embeddings&quot; are, what is meant by &quot;training&quot;, and most of the rest - though I&#x27;m still learning jargon. I wrote a script to iterate over every single word of every single book to rank how likely it is that word will appear next, if given a cursor, and extended that to rank entire phrases. The base decoder started out what I&#x27;ll call &quot;token-agnostic&quot; - didn&#x27;t care if you were looking for the next letter... word... pixel... it&#x27;s the same logic. But actually it&#x27;s not, and it soon evolved into a text (language) model. But I have plans to get into image generation next (next-pixel prediction), using this. Overall the concepts are similar, but there are differences primarily around extraction and formatting.<p>Goals of the project:<p>- Demystify LLMs for people, show that it&#x27;s just regular code that does normal stuff<p>- Actually make a pretty good LLM in JavaScript, with a version at least capable of running in a browser tab"
