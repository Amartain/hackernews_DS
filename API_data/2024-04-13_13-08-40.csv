Now that I&#x27;m done with mine I wanna share some anecdotal evidence that doing a PhD can actually be enjoyable (not necessarily easy) and also be doable in 3 years.<p>When I started I knew I didn&#x27;t want to work on something that would never leave the lab or languish in a dissertation PDF no one will ever read. Thanks to an awesome advisor I think I managed to thread the needle between simplicity and functionality.<p>Looking back, the ideas and methods behind it are pretty straightforward, but getting there took some doing. It’s funny how things seem obvious once you&#x27;ve figured them out!<p>Oh, I love creating GUIs for sensor data and visualizations as you&#x27;ll see -- it&#x27;s such a game changer! pyqtgraph is my go-to at the moment - such a great library."

Indeed, it was much faster than creating a new backoffice. But not as quick as we imagined. Integrating with Google&#x27;s SDK requires some effort, especially to handle the OAuth logic, configure it in the console, and understand the documentation (which is quite shallow, by the way).<p>Anyway! We did the project and I realized that maybe other devs might have encountered similar issues. Therefore, I developed a tool that transforms Google spreadsheets into &quot;realtime APIs&quot; with PATCH, GET, POST, and DELETE methods.<p>Since it&#x27;s a product for devs, I think it would be cool to hear your opinions.

* In-Browser coding: Write, run, and debug code directly in your browser. No more downloading software, configuring environments, and resolving compatibility issues.
* Course management: Manage classes, assignments, and student interactions in one place.
* Many languages supported: Python, Java, JavaScript, C&#x2F;C++, C#, Go, PHP – more incoming.<p>Open beta access: I’d love it if interested people could join my open beta, explore the platform&#x27;s capabilities, and provide some feedback to help me make it a better tool.<p>Thank you for your time!<p>Contact: support@classroomio.app"

Ours is interesting because it&#x27;s a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;</a><p>Others do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;descriptinc&#x2F;descript-audio-codec"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;descriptinc&#x2F;descript-audio-codec</a>) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion model is also particularly interesting because it is the first audio diffusion model to generate coherent lyrics!<p>We like diffusion models for music generation because they have some interesting properties that make controlling them easier (so you can make <i>your own</i> music instead of just taking what the machine gives you). For example, we have a rhythm control mode where you can upload your own percussion line or set a BPM. Very soon you&#x27;ll also be able to generate proper variations of an uploaded or previously generated song (e.g., you could even sing into Voice Memos for a minute and upload that!). @Musicians of HN, try uploading your songs and using Rhythm Control&#x2F;let us know what you think! Our goal is to enable more of you, not replace you.<p>For example, we turned this drum line (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz</a>) into this full song (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7</a> skip to 1:05 if impatient) or this other song I like better (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;songs&#x2F;qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins</a> - we accidentally compressed it with AAC instead of Opus which hurt quality, though)<p>We also like diffusion models because while they&#x27;re expensive to train, they&#x27;re cheap to serve. We built our own efficient inference infrastructure instead of using those expensive inference as a service startups that are all the rage. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re making generations on our site free and unlimited for as long as possible.<p>We&#x27;d love to answer your questions. Let us know what you think of our first model! <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonauto.ai&#x2F;</a>"

An important hypothesis of this project is that, by observing the train of thought and witnessing the simulated state of mind and emotional emulation surrounding it, humans could empathize with a machine. What happens when that&#x27;s the case? Would people enjoy companionship from a synthetic person? Would the Art establishment ever consider a non-human author (capable of making art and interacting with other humans) an Artist?<p>Whatever the answers, I can&#x27;t shake away the feeling that human uniqueness is being eroded and that we risk facing a crisis of meaning. Perhaps projects such as this help us demonize those fears, similarly to how sci-fi does, even though the boundary between fiction and reality is blurring.<p>This was a collaboration with Tibor (hn user: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=tiborsaas"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=tiborsaas</a>).

Annotate lets you create step-by-step code walkthroughs, inspired by Stripe’s documentation (e.g., <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stripe.com&#x2F;checkout&#x2F;quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.stripe.com&#x2F;checkout&#x2F;quickstart</a>) for your technical product. It comes with a React SDK that lets you  embed walkthroughs directly in your docs or marketing materials. Check out an example walkthrough on the home page.<p>Why build Annotate? I’ve been in the dev tooling space for the last 5 years and have two main learnings:<p>1. Developers first look for a quick start guide when exploring a technical product. A great quick start increase developer adoption.<p>2. Developers typically prefer code snippets that closely resemble real-world applications over traditional longer-form docs.<p>Annotate helps you solve both above points.<p>Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!"

I want to share a spreadsheet tool we are building. The main idea is to be able to specify logic for a no code tool inside a spreadsheet. We have automations, data integration,  action formulas, dashboards.<p>Linked example: We use our UPDATECELL formula to make a step in a board of game of life. We can also use CHAIN to make it run indefinitely. The actions are exposed as buttons in a dashboard.<p>Our automations work by loading your spreadsheet on the server and running an action specified in  the spreadsheet. So the logic could be, pull in data from google sheet, send a personalized email to every row which we haven’t emailed yet, mark those rows as complete. Run this automation on 5 minute schedule, add any other custom logic you need (e.g. test email for deliverability) and you have yourself an automatic email tool.<p>We are leaning into automations to differentiate ourselves from other products in the field at the moment.<p>Technical kinks:<p>- Since our automations make changes to the spreadsheet, we needed a robust multiplayer system. We implemented a CRDT system. This is a topic for a longer blog post, but one fun challenge was to implement CRDT for rows&#x2F;column which allowed for adding&#x2F;deleting&#x2F;reordering performantly while preserving most user intent in the case of offline editing.
- Some of our formulas are inherently asynchronous; for example those which fetch data from an external data source. That added an extra kink when writing the spreadsheet engine; e.g. topologically sorting and then evaluating in order can cause you to get stuck on a long running evaluation.
- One of our premises is that we do not store your data; it gets pulled when the spreadsheet evaluates. That means everything reevaluates in the browser when you open a spreadsheet. Get this to be performant (we still have a long way to go) was a challenge. Currently, everything runs in a single worker.<p>Let me know what you all think."

I added it to the repo for reference.<p>When it clicked in my head that &quot;knowing a fact&quot; is nearly synonymous with predicting a word (or series of words), I wanted to put it to the test, because it seemed so simple. I chose JavaScript because I can exploit the way it structures objects to aid in the modeling of language.<p>For example:<p>&quot;I want to be at the beach&quot;, 
&quot;I will do it later&quot;, 
&quot;I want to know the answer&quot;, 
...<p>becomes:<p><pre><code>  {
    I: { 
      want: { 
        to: { 
          be: { ... }, 
          know: { ... }
        }
      },
      will: { ... }
    },
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
in JavaScript. You can exploit the language&#x27;s fast object lookup speed to find known sentences this way, rather than recursively searching text - which is the convention and would take forever or not work at all considering there are several full books loaded in by default (and it could support many more).<p>Accompanying research yielded learnings about what &quot;tokens&quot; and &quot;embeddings&quot; are, what is meant by &quot;training&quot;, and most of the rest - though I&#x27;m still learning jargon. I wrote a script to iterate over every single word of every single book to rank how likely it is that word will appear next, if given a cursor, and extended that to rank entire phrases. The base decoder started out what I&#x27;ll call &quot;token-agnostic&quot; - didn&#x27;t care if you were looking for the next letter... word... pixel... it&#x27;s the same logic. But actually it&#x27;s not, and it soon evolved into a text (language) model. But I have plans to get into image generation next (next-pixel prediction), using this. Overall the concepts are similar, but there are differences primarily around extraction and formatting.<p>Goals of the project:<p>- Demystify LLMs for people, show that it&#x27;s just regular code that does normal stuff<p>- Actually make a pretty good LLM in JavaScript, with a version at least capable of running in a browser tab"

I can only imagine the complexities they have to deal with, and at the same time there is a potential negative monetary impact. Valve makes boat loads of $$ from Counter-Strike through skins for weapons and models. It is its own economy. Banning people, even though they are cheaters, is money lost.<p>Furthermore, some of the solutions to deal with cheaters are to play on 3rd party services (i.e. FACEIT) that require you to install an &quot;anti-cheat&quot; that gives kernel level access and is owned by some questionable folks (I won&#x27;t get into the details of that you can do your own research).<p>That brings us to GamingHerd. For now, my idea is to be Google for PC video game cheaters, smurfs (read this about smurfs <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idnow.io&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;smurfing&#x2F;#:~:text=What%20is%20Smurfing%20in%20gaming,alternate%20account%20or%20multiple%20accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idnow.io&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;smurfing&#x2F;#:~:text=What%20is%20...</a>.), racists, throwers, etc. People you do not want to play video games with. Let me tell you, there are a lot, unfortunately.<p>Currently, I am working to grow this into a community and build a matchmaking service around it. The matchmaking would obviously utilize the Toxic Gaming DB (TGDB) to never allow them to use the service.
