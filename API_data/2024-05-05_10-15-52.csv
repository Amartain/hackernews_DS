- Share photos, documents, videos, and more with ease, no matter the size.
- Connect instantly with anyone for speedy and reliable file transfers, bypassing the need for centralized servers.
- Get started in minutes with our intuitive interface designed for seamless communication. No registration.
- Easily connect with others using QR codes, simplifying the sharing process further.<p>The inspiration behind NeighborHoodShare stemmed from a common dilemma: the reluctance to share personal contact details like phone numbers or email addresses when sharing photos or messages with strangers. With NeighborHoodShare, you can share content securely without compromising your privacy.<p>I would be happy to hear your feedback and suggestions for improving NeighborHoodShare.<p>I had written a blog on how p2p networking in browsers work: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dikshantraj2001.medium.com&#x2F;nat-stun-turn-and-ice-466dabbc2fdb"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dikshantraj2001.medium.com&#x2F;nat-stun-turn-and-ice-466...</a>"

We are also trying to make it more no-nonsense (no hidden fees, no H100 behind “contact sales”, etc.).<p>The tech to make this work is actually kind of nifty, we may do an in-depth HN post on that soon.<p>Right now, we have H100s, a few RTX 4090s and a GTX 1080 Ti online. Feel free to try it out!<p>Also, if you’ve got compute sitting around (a GPU cluster, a crypto mining operation or just a GPU) or if you’re an AI company with idle compute (hopefully not in a Stability AI way) and want to see some ROI, it’s very simple and flexible to hook it up to our site and you’ll maybe get a few researchers using your compute.<p>Nice rest of the week!"

And that sparked my curiosity with this question, what is considered affordable hardware for running large language models locally today? I&#x27;m aware that there&#x27;s a lot of work underway to make inference cheap to run at the edge but I&#x27;m curious to understand the landscape at present that anyone could purchase. I seen people running models on flagship smartphones but those are more expensive then a mac mini with worse performance.<p>By affordable I mean no greater then the cost of a current gen base model mac mini ($599) but ideally around the price of a raspberry pi 5 ($79) which when searching for budget PC gets mentioned[2]. Both devices have the same amount of ram in my case (8gb) but different performance observed given the importance of memory bandwidth. I mention these two because I&#x27;ve had experience running llama 3 via ollama on both with success although of slower speeds compared to a full workstation with a commodity GPU i.e. RTX 4090 which starts at ($1599). I&#x27;m interested in learning about what other devices are out there that people consider cheap and use for LLMs locally.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38646969<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;picks&#x2F;the-best-budget-desktop-computers"

Currently, it requires a single GPU with 16-24 GiB of memory, but we also plan to release a CPU-only version.<p>- Training and execution are also quick - for a dataset on the order of 1000 emails, training Panza takes well under an hour, and generating a new email takes a few seconds at most."

We’ve been working in the RAG space for a little over a year now, and we’ve recently decided to open-source all of our core retrieval tech.<p>spRAG is a retrieval system that’s designed to handle complex real-world queries over dense text, like legal documents and financial reports. As far as we know, it produces the most accurate and reliable results of any RAG system for these kinds of tasks. For example, on FinanceBench, which is an especially challenging open-book financial question answering benchmark, spRAG gets 83% of questions correct, compared to 19% for the vanilla RAG baseline (which uses Chroma + OpenAI Ada embeddings + LangChain).<p>You can find more info about how it works and how to use it in the project’s README. We’re also very open to contributions. We especially need contributions around integrations (i.e. adding support for more vector DBs, embedding models, etc.) and around evaluation."

That&#x27;s achieved by leveraging OpenAI&#x27;s latest embedding models alongside more traditional indexes extracted from the scraped and cleaned up contents of the links.<p>I think there are many more interesting things one could build atop the HN dataset in the age of LLMs (e.g. more explicitly searching for technical opinions, recommending stories to you based on your interests, and making the core search feature more useful).

I’ll find myself nearly word-for-word copying the information I need. This is a habit from my years in education where I would basically transcribe lectures as a way to maintain attention as a strategy for ADHD. Therefore, my notes end up a muddled version of the source material and I’ll just use the source material for reference, making the initial note take a big waste of time from the standpoint of having an easy reference available.<p>Another problem I run into is that when I’m very attentive to a task or piece of information and want to take some note on it or reference notes from elsewhere, switching contexts to my notes is disruptive.<p>Are there any resources you recommend for effective note-taking?"

Task managers handle one-off tasks effectively, but falter with routines. On the other hand, project management software often feels overly complex. What I wanted was in the Goldilocks Zone between Todoist and Jira.<p>For my own personal use, I created StepList. I&#x27;ve used it to assist and track workouts, my daily workday, software deployment and setup, household management, and more. Over the last year I&#x27;ve prepared StepList for sharing with others, and it&#x27;s finally ready. It&#x27;s designed to be unobtrusive and straightforward, allowing you to focus seamlessly on your tasks.<p>Key features include:<p>Easy List Creation: Quickly make lists with basic formatting options.<p>Search and Access: Find your lists and those shared by others.<p>Efficient Execution: Perform tasks swiftly, whether on a computer or mobile browser.<p>Flexible Scheduling: Set up lists to be done once or on a recurring basis, with email reminders.<p>Simple Delegation: Assign lists via email, no StepList account needed for collaborators.<p>StepList is fairly vanilla Rails 7 app. I&#x27;ve found Hotwire to be a powerful tool for building apps that work well on mobile and desktop (though in a few key places, I eschew it to keep things fast).<p>StepList is free to use, with a $5&#x2F;month premium plan for unlimited scheduled, delegated, and private lists.<p>- Drew"
